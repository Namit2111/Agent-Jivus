1,Prospect,Doug Markham.
1,SDR,"Morning, Doug. How are you?"
1,Prospect,I'm fine. How are you?
1,SDR,"Good. Good. Doing good, Doug. So, Doug, Josh again from Contango. I did speak to you, I guess not last week. Last week, you were really traveling at that time. I caught you on a Friday, and you were really busy, so you asked me to call back after some time. So, Doug, again, like calling from Contango, I did send you that email once again, and you said you'd check it over the weekend. I don't know if you've checked that or not, but we are a full-service IT provider. The reason I was calling today is I just wanted to quickly set up a 15-20 minute call with one of my senior account guys. We can tell you more about what Contango IT is, what we do, and how we do it. I really think, because we have been working with similar companies like yours, that we can add value to your business. It's not something I want to sell to you right at the moment; it's more about understanding your business a little bit more and you understanding our products and services. I just need 20 minutes of your time to explain a little bit more about Contango."
1,Prospect,"What is your specialty? I mean, walk me through your developers, your IT resource. What's your suite?"
1,SDR,"Well, if I talk about the services and products, Doug, we are a 100-person company with four different departments, covering everything from networks to outsourced CIO to help desk to application programming, infrastructure, everything A to Z in IT services. Honestly, getting into the tech details of these products and services, I would love to answer all your questions, but I'm not the correct person to do that. That's why I wanted someone senior from my team to tell you what we can do for you and how we can add value to your business. We're not the kind of company that just picks up the phone and sells something right away."
1,Prospect,"Well, this week, I mean, probably the best thing to do is get a debrief and then.."
1,SDR,"Yeah, yeah. We can possibly give you the first introduction, and if required, we can pull in anyone else from your company to go into a more detailed discussion. Generally, what we do is have the first discovery call, and then we can give you something like a need assessment. That's what we call it, and then we can go from there. So this first call is just a discovery call."
1,Prospect,"Friday, I'm kind of open from 11:30 till 1:30 Central Time. See if a little 15-minute window fits in there."
1,SDR,"Yeah, 11:30."
1,Prospect,You said 11:30 to 1:30 Central. I am open this Friday the 17th.
1,SDR,"Friday the 17th, right? Yep, yep. That's no problem. I can speak to one of the best people from my team, the senior guys, and try to get them on the call. I'll try to get the best one. And last time I checked, you were about 40 people in the office, or has that increased, decreased in any way?"
1,Prospect,That's accurate.
1,SDR,That's accurate. And how do you currently manage your IT? Is it something that you do a little bit in-house and a little bit outsourced?
1,Prospect,"Our VP of engineering does it all. That's what I'm saying, he drives it."
1,SDR,"I get that. And you are headquartered in Canada with another four locations, one in Nashville, Tennessee, and others in Tennessee and Miami."
1,Prospect,We're North America.
1,SDR,"Yep, yep, yep. Cool. No problem, Doug. And your email is Doug at wise docs AI?"
1,Prospect,"Right, just send me an invite if a 15-minute window fits on the 17th between those hours."
1,SDR,"Yeah, definitely. I will do that. No problem."
1,Prospect,And then I'll push you over to our VP of engineering to dig a little deeper.
1,SDR,"Yeah, sure. We can definitely do that. Okay. All right, sounds good. Thanks. You have a nice day. Bye bye."
1,Prospect,You too. Take care.
2,SDR,"Hi, good afternoon. Am I speaking to Justin?"
2,Prospect,Yes.
2,SDR,"Hi, Justin. Josh from Contango. How are you?"
2,Prospect,"Good, how are you?"
2,SDR,"Doing great, great. Doing good, Justin. Thanks for asking. So, Justin, just a quick one. I had actually sent you an email a few days back, so I was just trying to reach out to you to see if you've got the email. And did you get a chance to look at that?"
2,Prospect,Okay. I'm still catching up on emails. Who did it come from?
2,SDR,That's Contango.
2,Prospect,Contango. How do you spell that?
2,SDR,That's C-O-N-T-A-N-G-O.
2,Prospect,And you said it was a few days ago?
2,SDR,"Yeah, a few days ago."
2,Prospect,You said C-A-N-G-O?
2,SDR,C-O-N-T-A-N-G-O.
2,Prospect,I'm not getting anything. Come up. C-O-N-T-A-N-G-O.
2,SDR,Yep.
2,Prospect,Okay. Nothing's coming up.
2,SDR,"No, never mind. Never mind. I can resend you the email."
2,Prospect,"Okay, what's it regarding?"
2,SDR,"Yeah, that's where I was coming to. So, as I'm calling from Contango, Justin, we are a full-service IT company, and we have been working with firms like yours. They are really happy customers. The reason for my call today is I just wanted to have a quick 20 minutes sometime next week where I can possibly get one of my senior account guys on the call and explain more about what Contango IT is, what we do, and how we do it. I'd be very confident in saying we can definitely add value to your business because we have been working with similar customers like yours. So I was just looking to see if we can have 20 minutes of your time sometime next week."
2,Prospect,"Okay, let's see here."
2,SDR,"Probably, like, next Thursday, the 16th."
2,Prospect,Okay. And you said you're an IT company?
2,SDR,"IT company. Right. I will definitely send that email once again, and you can go through all the website and things like that."
2,Prospect,"Okay. All right, let's start off with that, and I'll let you know what we're thinking."
2,SDR,"Okay, so let me send you this calendar invite for next Thursday, the 16th, with all the information, probably around 3:00 PM after lunchtime when you're not really super busy, and then we can go from there."
2,Prospect,"Okay, sounds good."
3,Prospect,Hey.
3,SDR,"Hi, mister. This is Amir with Growfin AI. I've called you completely out of the blue here today. We've never spoken before. Is this a good time to speak very briefly, or have I called you at the worst minute today?"
3,Prospect,"Very briefly. Very briefly. Sorry, I didn't catch your name."
3,SDR,My name is Amir and I'm with Growfin AI. Growfin. Does that name ring a bell at all?
3,Prospect,Grillfin? No.
3,SDR,"Okay, so I'm gonna be really brief, mister. I have been on your LinkedIn. I have seen you've got tremendous endorsements in terms of account receivables. I see your experience. I had a couple of quick questions. One thing I hear a lot from collection managers is that it's a top priority to keep past due payments less compared to outstanding receivables. How do you go about doing that today, Mister Silver?"
3,Prospect,"Well, obviously we have a team, but.. So, Amir, are you selling something? Do you have a service? What is this in regards to?"
3,SDR,"Service, obviously this is a cold call. I want to gain insights. But to be really transparent, we have built an AR automation solution which is purpose-built for account receivables. It integrates with your system, pulls in data, pulls out data, and it sort of streamlines the entire end-to-end AR process, including cash applications, reconciliations, and so forth. Given your experience, I was wondering if you'd be inclined towards perhaps, maybe exploring—not purchasing—not talking about, hey, we want to purchase this, nothing like that. Just exploring what we offer and see if there's some sort of technical fitment. And perhaps, in the worst case scenario, we'll just part ways as friends."
3,Prospect,"So the only thing I can suggest at this point, Amir, is to send us any information, literature, documents, anything that you can, and we will have to take a look at it from our end. Right now, you know, it's the end of the year, end of the quarter coming up. It's a very busy time. I won't be able to look at anything until the new year. But if you want to send us something, by all means, send us what you have and we will eventually take a look at it."
3,SDR,"Absolutely. Is there anything specific, based on challenges, based on what you foresee coming up in the upcoming quarters, any challenges in particular? Anything in particular you're looking for in this email?"
3,Prospect,"No. Just to see what you guys offer. I mean, there's a lot of businesses and a lot of software out there that do the exact same thing. And we're always open to something if it's worth it for us. So if you want to send me something, we'll definitely take a look at it."
3,SDR,"Absolutely. Will do. To give you some context, just so my email stands out from others—I believe you get a whole bunch of these emails and calls—we are a collaboration-first solution. What we recognize is there's a silo between the sales team and the finance teams. Finance cannot collaborate with sales except for over emails like Slack or phone calls or whatnot. So the AR solution that I'm talking about, Growfin, is a collaboration-first AR solution. It sort of gives you that front to collaborate with your sales teams as well. I know it's the end of the month, it's also the end of the year. Next year, in the first week of January, you'll probably be tied up with closing as well. I promise I won't take much of your time—perhaps maybe in the second week of January. 15 minutes is all I ask, 15 minutes."
3,Prospect,"I'll be honest with you, I won't be available in December. If anything happens, it will have to be in the new year."
3,SDR,"Understood. Got it. New year it is then. So I'm going to send you an email. Is it okay if I place a placeholder on your calendar for the second week of January? The reason I'm saying this is because I don't want to make it sound like a cold call again when I reach out to you in January. I'll follow up with you multiple times over email. I'll send you some beautiful stuff, literature about what we do, keep you engaged. And come January, we could absolutely just set up 15 to 20 minutes. We give you a brief, see if there's technical fitment, and then if you're interested, we could perhaps keep the conversation going. Sounds good?"
3,Prospect,"That's fine. And it's Grillfin, G-R-I-L..?"
3,SDR,"If you're in front of your system, I would encourage you to go to Growfin dot AI."
3,Prospect,"Growfin dot AI? Yep. Okay. All right, send me what you have and we'll take a look at it."
3,SDR,"Can I also set a placeholder on your calendar? If you permit me, for January 10th, which is the second week. It's a Wednesday, perhaps maybe 11:00 AM. I'm not sure."
3,Prospect,How about the third week? Do the third week of January.
3,SDR,Third week of January. Wednesday works fine? Or are Fridays better for you?
3,Prospect,Probably Wednesdays.
3,SDR,Wednesday. And what time zone are you in?
3,Prospect,Eastern time zone.
3,SDR,"Eastern time zone. Would 11:00 AM be too early, or do you prefer post-lunch, around 2:00 PM or so?"
3,Prospect,"No, 11:00 is fine."
3,SDR,"11:00 is fine. Beautiful. I'm going to keep in touch with you, Mister. You've been really, really kind. You've given me tremendous time. I appreciate it. Looking forward to speaking with you a month and a half down the line."
3,Prospect,All right. Very good.
3,SDR,Thank you. Thank you so much. All the very best. Bye bye.
3,Prospect,"Thank you. All right, bye."
4,Prospect,Hello
4,SDR,Nancy?
4,Prospect,Yeah
4,SDR,"Nancy, it is Andrea Kleiman and I am an absolute stranger, so don't rack your brain trying to figure it out. I don't know you. You don't know me. A complete stranger here. Are you able to talk for a brief moment?"
4,Prospect,I have about a minute.
4,SDR,"Oh, beautiful. That's all I need. Okay, wonderful. Look, I was online and I was doing some research for another realtor in Tucson, and I actually came across your name. So I wanted to find out, are you still doing real estate? Are you doing it as a hobby or are you doing it as a career?"
4,Prospect,I'm doing it full time.
4,SDR,"Okay. You're doing it full time? Okay, wonderful. I know that you said I had a minute, so I don't want to be disrespectful, but I do marketing for realtors. I help you guys with web, social, and more. My quick question was, do you have any personal interest in improving your web presence for the future? Because I know it's a really, really, really hot market out there. You guys are doing very well and I just wanted to see if I can get some time with you another day and let you interview me. You're the boss. I'm just applying for the job—just interview me and see what I have to offer. But I really feel like there's an asset in me helping you."
4,Prospect,"First of all, I like your style. It's nice because I haven't hung up on you yet. So awesome. Second of all, I have a really good friend who is doing the same thing, who is trying to get me to do the same thing. And so I've just started working with her. We've just started a business Facebook page, doing a few things. And so honestly, I know I need some help, but I'll be working with her, though."
4,SDR,"This is heartbreaking. I'm actually crying right now. Nancy, you know, unfortunately, I was taught a long time ago that I gotta get at least 20 no's. We're only on no one right now."
4,Prospect,Okay.
4,SDR,"Look, look, here's the deal. I'm a good team player, right? I used to play football for years. I grew up here in San Diego. Most of my friends played professional football. My good friend Leroy Glover is actually getting inducted into the Hall of Fame. You probably know a lot of my friends. You know Marshall Faulk?"
4,Prospect,"No, I don't."
4,SDR,"Okay, you're not a football buff. Okay, fine. Whatever. Bottom line is, I'm all about teamwork. If you have someone that is going to participate in helping you grow your life and your business, first of all, congratulations, because realtors work so hard. And I know that you guys put a lot of time and energy into just learning new tools and new technology. So cheers to you for even taking a leap of faith in paying her to do that. How much are you paying her? Is this like $1,500 a month? Is this $2,000? How much do you gotta pay to make her do all this stuff for you?"
4,Prospect,"Well, in addition to her, I also have a coach, so I am well ingrained in that. I need help."
4,SDR,"Okay, rewind. How much are you paying this coach? Because I know what coaches charge. I travel quite a bit around the country. The last coach I met was charging $6,000."
4,Prospect,My coach isn't quite that expensive. But you know what? My time is truly up. I have a client walking in.
4,SDR,Okay.
4,Prospect,"And I've got to go. But I like your style. I think you're going to do fine. And here's your no, I'm sorry."
5,SDR,"Hey, this is Colin with Ledium here. I'm actually giving you a call for the first time. Do you have like half a minute? I can tell you exactly why I decided to cold call you today."
5,Prospect,Sure. Yeah.
5,SDR,"So the reason I'm reaching out is really just to introduce my company to you, Ledium. When I'm not calling you out of the blue, are you available like, say, Tuesday or Thursday around 09:00 your time next week?"
5,Prospect,For what?
5,SDR,"Yeah, I definitely want to make sure it's relevant. Again, I'm calling from Ledium. It's a bit of a small industry with what we do, but have you ever heard of us before?"
5,Prospect,"No, I haven't. Yeah."
5,SDR,"So we work with growth stage companies, helping them to supplement their sales development efforts."
5,Prospect,Really?
5,SDR,Just wanted to ask you a question. Have you ever evaluated the performance of your in-house team versus an outsourced sales development team?
5,Prospect,"I'm doing that currently now, yeah."
5,SDR,Awesome! And how have things been going?
5,Prospect,I don't know. I'm going to be running a pilot with an outside sales team.
5,SDR,Got it. Okay. When is that supposed to be getting kicked off?
5,Prospect,As soon as we make a decision. Probably in the next two weeks.
5,SDR,"Yeah. I mean, I know sometimes, you know, I'm not always so lucky for the timing to be as perfect as this, but what are the chances I could throw my hat in the ring to put us in there as an option? You know, would it be a terrible idea to get like 15 minutes?"
5,Prospect,"So tell me, tell me your spiel. Yeah. Help me understand what technologies you use. Yeah. Tell me what—let me give you a—I'll give you a real quick, high-level thing. Sure. I've already engaged with four different companies or competitors of yours. Yeah. So I'm reluctant to use you. Yeah. But here's your shot. Yeah. We're a major Microsoft partner. Yep. A lot of what we do is work with the Microsoft Teams and their VPs and their ten to twenty sales reps. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to develop a pilot around one of those VPs, probably in the Midwest around manufacturing as a vertical. So what I want to understand is how you would run this pilot. Yes. There's ten sales reps that we support. That's probably 1,000 to 5,000 enterprise customers. And I'll probably run this around the Power Platform. So it's going to be director level and above that I'm going to be having you guys reach out to. Yes."
5,SDR,"So, I mean, look, I know I'm calling you out of the blue. I'm more than willing to take my shot here, but without getting too deep in the weeds and getting too pitchy or salesy here on this call. You know, we're a small boutique firm. We only manage about 30 clients at a time. Our founders have been in business for over ten years. Funny story is, I actually used to be a customer of Ledium before I actually started working with them now as a partner. And they helped me scale a unified communications platform all the way to exit. So that's me taking my shot really quick in a short amount of time without taking up too much of your time. But why don't we do this? Just give me 15-20 minutes on the calendar, either Thursday or Friday, then we can get into a little bit more detail, a strategy of how I'd run the POC for you."
5,Prospect,"You're really late to the table on this. I don't have the time. So I'm looking for your pitch now. If you can't do it, that's fine, but I'm looking for your pitch now."
5,SDR,"Sure I could, but it would just be shooting off the hip a bit. Like I know a little bit about what you do. I didn't expect you to be actively buying for this right now. Doesn't always work out that way. If you want to give me 20 minutes, I can tell you it'd be worth it. And at the end of that 20 minutes, if you feel like it's not a good fit, we can part friends. I think that in 20 minutes you could hear enough to at least pop us up to your first or second choice before making a decision. What's the worst that could happen? Would Thursday or Friday work better for you?"
5,Prospect,Friday at 11:30 to 12:00 Eastern.
5,SDR,"All right, you got it. What's the best email for you? So it was first name, last name, and then what was the last part there? All right, I'll send that over for 11:30 your time on Friday, and I'll send you over a bit of information so you have a little more context going into that call. Fair enough?"
5,Prospect,"Okay, thanks."
5,SDR,"All right, thanks for your time."
5,Prospect,Appreciate it.
6,Prospect,Hello.
6,SDR,"Hey, this is Heidi. How's your Friday going?"
6,Prospect,"Pretty good, how are you doing?"
6,SDR,"Well, thanks. Not sure if you had a moment, but I had a few questions. Is this a good time?"
6,Prospect,Sure.
6,SDR,"Okay, cool. I see that you head up insights and analytics, and I'm definitely a big fan of using it a lot. Unfortunately, maybe unfortunately, but I know you guys have an online chat with wine experts, that type of thing. Do you look at analytics for those conversations at all or not really?"
6,Prospect,"A little bit, I'd say. We're sort of in the process of getting those learnings. We use Zendesk, so we're kind of downloading that data out of Zendesk and combining it with our internal data. So that's sort of an ongoing process, I'd say."
6,SDR,"Totally. Well, we actually created something to help you out with that and have like a dashboard in one place. We're kind of trying to get some feedback from people in the US. It's pretty popular in Europe already. So I was wondering if that's something you might want to check out. No pressure situation, but just see how it works for the future."
6,Prospect,Sure.
6,SDR,Okay. Would you have time to chat like Monday or Tuesday?
6,Prospect,Mondays are pretty busy for me.
6,SDR,"Oh, yeah, Tuesdays would be better maybe."
6,Prospect,"Yeah, Tuesday would be better. Tuesday morning."
6,SDR,"Let me see, you guys are based in.."
6,Prospect,Yeah. Cool.
6,SDR,"So actually Michael, that could meet with you. He's really awesome. Let me see, Tuesday afternoon."
6,Prospect,I could do Tuesday at 03:00 p.m. Pacific.
6,SDR,"Okay, sweet. Tuesday at three. Cool. So I'll send you an invite for a meeting with Michael. Let me just make sure I got a good email for you. I have.. Okay. I have.. Does that work?"
6,Prospect,Yep.
6,SDR,"Okay, sweet. All right, cool. So hopefully I put your email in there correctly. If I didn't, that's my bad. I'll just let Michael know and you'll be meeting with him, and he'll just go over what our analytics looks like and how it would work with what you already have. And yeah, we can get some feedback from you and see what you think."
6,Prospect,Sounds good.
6,SDR,"Okay, cool. Is there anything that you'd like me to tell him that you want to see specifically? Like, are there certain numbers and metrics that you're looking for so that we can make the most out of your time?"
6,Prospect,"I would say what we're probably most interested in is thinking about the lifetime value of customers who interact with the chat versus those who don't. Like, you know, our chat is—we have customer service, but then we also have a recommendations chat. So there are people who are wine experts that are there to help you non-commission. So it's really.. Obviously, you know, we want them to help people find wine, but not like a salesperson. So just understanding, you know, that interaction."
6,SDR,"Yeah, absolutely. Okay, cool. Well, we have a few cool things with that too. If you ever don't have somebody that's available, we actually have product experts that can jump in to give you full coverage. So I can make sure Michael tells you about how that would work, what metrics you'd be looking at, and what the suite looks like. Okay, awesome. Anybody else that would maybe want to be on the call that would feel left out or..?"
6,Prospect,"No, I think it's fine to do just me for now."
6,SDR,"Okay, well, appreciate your time, hope you have a really great weekend, and I'll let Michael know what you were looking to see, and we look forward to speaking with you."
6,Prospect,"Cool. All right, thanks."
7,Prospect,Bryan speaking.
7,SDR,"Oh, is this you?"
7,Prospect,Yeah. Who's this?
7,SDR,"Oh, dude, this is sick. This is Jacob. I'm cold calling you, but I figured being in sales, you'd be open to it."
7,Prospect,Yeah. Where are you calling from?
7,SDR,"Calling from Service Bell. And the reason I'm calling you specifically is I saw your post on, or your comment on a post about, well, the top ten things that he learned in his early sales role. You specifically mentioned you cared about speed to lead."
7,Prospect,Yeah.
7,SDR,I have the best speed to lead solution on the market. That's why I'm calling you.
7,Prospect,"Okay. Sounds good! Yeah, so what do you guys.. what do you guys do?"
7,SDR,"So I can notify you when a prospect is on your website, like in real time, on an important page. And then you can call them on the website, like video call them instantly on the website and catch them at the perfect time instead of having to email, follow up later, chase them down, etcetera."
7,Prospect,"Interesting, and do they have to prompt that? Like, do you do that through, like, an intercom thing or something?"
7,SDR,"You do not have to. It's kind of like intercom but with video. And it.. It's easier if you see it. In fact, if you go to servicebell.com, I can just call you and show you right now. It might be easier."
7,Prospect,Sure. Yeah. Or even.. Yeah. Do you mind? I'm just.. I'm actually just at lunch right now. Do you mind even just shooting me an email with that link? I'll take a look at it. And let's call maybe on a Friday or something.
7,SDR,"That works for me. I have a post I did on LinkedIn that shows how this works. That got a lot of attention. So I'll tag you in it, if that's cool. And then Friday.. Are you.. You're in Vancouver. Oh, is that.. Is it 01:00 for you? 1:15?"
7,Prospect,"Yes, it is."
7,SDR,"Okay, great. You mentioned Friday morning or afternoon?"
7,Prospect,uhm.. Let's do morning.
7,SDR,Okay. How about 10:00 a.m. your time?
7,Prospect,"Yeah. I'm gonna just look here quickly. Yep, that works."
7,SDR,"Okay, great. And your email?"
7,Prospect,Give me a shot then. It's just my first name.
7,SDR,"Okay, cool. One last question for you is.. So the post I'm going to tag you in is a live cold call where basically I make outbound sales content on LinkedIn and YouTube to kind of teach people how to cold call and also help me generate leads. Do you mind if I use this as part of the content?"
7,Prospect,"Yeah, sure. That's fine."
7,SDR,"Dude, thank you, you're the man. I'll see you Friday and I'll shoot you.. Actually, a LinkedIn DM comment tag."
7,Prospect,Sounds good.
7,SDR,See you.
7,Prospect,"Yeah, sounds good. Thanks."
8,Prospect,Yes.
8,SDR,"Hey, what's going on? It's Landon over here at Anomalo. I know I'm kind of catching you out of the blue here, but I was hoping to tell you why I was giving you a ring."
8,Prospect,"Yeah, but I'm out of the office right now, so you can call me next week. That would be great."
8,SDR,Okay. Is it okay to tell you what it was about? Maybe I don't need to interrupt you again if this isn't in your peer review.
8,Prospect,"Okay, yeah, let me know."
8,SDR,"Yeah. Awesome. So I sent you a few emails. It was elation and Anomalo. We're the data quality monitoring platform that hooks up into elation so you can have better data quality at the table level in your data warehouse. I wasn't sure if that's something that I could call you back next week and talk with you about, or is that not in your peer review as the director of data and analytics?"
8,Prospect,"No.. I'm interested to know how that works. So, yeah, we can have a conversation next week, and probably I will bring the senior manager just to check how that works as well because we are making QA part of governance."
8,SDR,"Yeah, that makes sense. Awesome. What time works best for you next week?"
8,Prospect,I don't know. Try to call me on Wednesday.
8,SDR,Would it be okay just to set up like a quick 15-minute call so you can see the demo live of the elation integration?
8,Prospect,"Give me a minute, please."
8,SDR,Okay.
8,Prospect,I am checking my calendar. Give me a second.
8,SDR,"Yeah, no worries."
8,Prospect,Yeah. If you can do it at 01:00 p.m. MST.
8,SDR,01:00 p.m. Mountain Time. So that would be 12:00 Pacific Standard. Okay. Let me just make sure I have the right email for you.
8,Prospect,Do you have it? or no.
8,SDR,"Oh, yeah, sorry. No, it's loading really quick. Okay, I have it. And that is for 01:00 on Wednesday?"
8,Prospect,Yup!
8,SDR,Okay. I'll get that sent over to you right now.
8,Prospect,Thank you. Bye.
9,SDR,"Hi, this is Nitin calling you from a company called Whatfix. I was connecting with your colleagues at various levels and I came across your name. Do you have a minute to explain why I'm calling you specifically?"
9,Prospect,Yeah.
9,SDR,"We work with a lot of procurement directors like you. So what they say is in the procure-to-pay applications, the employees get stuck while raising a purchase request. You know, that leads to dozens of support requests being open for weeks at a time. I know this is challenging from an adoption standpoint, and we help organizations like Amazon, Facebook, NASA to solve this issue. Would you be open to learning more on how we help these organizations?"
9,Prospect,"Maybe not now because we are already doing an SAP implementation. So we're going through a cycle. So maybe later in the future once we finish with our implementation process, maybe then."
9,SDR,"Got it. We were already having a discussion with James and Murtuza from your team, and we understand that there's a lot of transformation going on. The idea behind this is to just show you what the platform looks like so that while implementing, you get an idea of how this looks."
9,Prospect,"Yeah. To be honest, if you've spoken to James and Murtuza, they should have given you the idea that we are not able to take up any more work for any other software. Because I think the first scope of action would be to actually implement what we have at hand and the work we are doing, and after that we probably can look into different systems. That's probably my opinion on it."
9,SDR,No worries.
9,Prospect,"Yeah, and I wouldn't be comfortable doing anything until I actually know what I'm doing currently and what's changing for me in the future and then look at another software. Because otherwise you can understand, right? It's just like buying anything in life. You buy three cars or four cars. What am I doing with four cars? I don't know, but if I know what I'm doing, then I can go to the next one and I can say, yeah, I'm using this for X kind of service within the business. Otherwise, I end up with four cars in my fleet and my business, and I wouldn't know what to do. So I hope you understand the situation."
9,SDR,"Yeah, exactly. You pointed it out rightly. When would be the right time to get back to you? Would it be two months or three months down the line?"
9,Prospect,"No, we wouldn't finish implementation until next February. That's what I've been given the timeline, next February, March, and once if everything goes well, we'll be finishing then. And then probably the conversation with any.. because I've had other people with different procurement-based softwares reach out as well. But as I said.."
9,SDR,"Got it, got it. So I understand that correctly. Just want to clarify that Whatfix is not a procure-to-pay application, it is an overlay for your SAP applications or any application that you are going to currently purchase. So the challenge that we solve is when you have this transformation. Right. The user adoption, user adapting to the software will be a challenge. We're going to solve that. But I understand your point. It'll be in the long run."
9,Prospect,"No, even user adoption is a good question. Right. Because when you think about it, I would imagine in terms of my first software, which I bought, the users need to be adept at that software, first of all how to understand and use it without actually spending more money. So once that's done, then we probably can look at other solutions."
9,SDR,"Yeah. So that is what exactly we do. So what we basically do is we overlay on top of the application and like a GPS, we give step-by-step guidance to the users in terms of how to use that application. So what we solve, particularly in organizations like Amazon, they were facing similar challenges while they were going through a lot of transformation. Users were not being able to adapt to this application, and there were dozens of support tickets going on and a lot of enablements, trainings, even though there's a forgetting curve where users forget what they learned in the classroom training. Right. So to solve that, what we do is the digital adoption overlay on top of your existing applications. So just curious to understand that, you know, if you could probably spend 15-20 minutes, probably next week just to show you the platform. I mean not in a hurry to take the next step forward just for your understanding purpose. Would you be open to more about that next week?"
9,Prospect,"Next week probably not the best. The week after maybe I could do something. But man, I don't want to set up the wrong expectation that we are looking to buy a software now even if your software is the best. I'm being quite straightforward so that I actually don't waste your time."
9,SDR,No worries.
9,Prospect,"At the same time, I understand you've got to follow up leads and you have to do things. I'm happy to work if you have.. if 15 minutes of my time makes a big difference in terms of following up your leads. I'm happy to do it, but I'm being upfront that I can't actually commit to a software now."
9,SDR,"Does it help? Yeah, it helps. So the main intention is to, you know, just to see if you like the software, probably, yes, it makes sense for us to, you know, get back to you probably by January, February, if it doesn't make sense. And probably, you know.."
9,Prospect,"Yeah, 100% what I said, man, because I, like, I'm happy to look at it if that actually helps within your business and you connect where you report into, and if you can actually tell them, hey, you've actually showcased it to someone happy to do that for 15 minutes. It doesn't make a massive difference in my time as long as it stays up to 15 minutes, and then I have zero commitment of buying it. I won't even trial it or no proof concept, nothing, because I actually can't even control what I'm doing currently because there's quite a lot of things changing on our side. And if you've spoken to Murtuza and James, they would have clearly kind of highlighted that we're going through a journey, and we need to finish the journey to actually understand what else we need to do. I understand that so many things can come up on that, and you can, as you said, you can overlay this for better adoption, but that's something which the team should have thought about when we started the journey, not as we go through the journey, because you're already on the journey, and I just don't want to actually add in more weight to it to actually make all of the other things on the way."
9,SDR,"Got it. Got it. Can we schedule something for probably the 13th or 14th, just a 15-minute chat?"
9,Prospect,Where are you based?
9,SDR,"I'm based in India, but my entire team works in Australia."
9,Prospect,So who's actually going to be showcasing this to me?
9,SDR,"Me and one of my colleagues, Santosh. He will be showcasing that."
9,Prospect,"Okay, so what time do you work?"
9,SDR,"So we usually start very early. Like, I start very early, probably around 5."
9,Prospect,"What time do you work based off, do you work Asian time? Do you work Pacific time or do you work American time?"
9,SDR,"I work for the ANC time, Australia time."
9,Prospect,"Okay, so what time do you start in the morning in India?"
9,SDR,"In India, probably around 05:00 a.m. so that'll be, I guess, 11:30 New Zealand time."
9,Prospect,05:00 a.m. did you say?
9,SDR,"Yeah, 05:00 a.m."
9,Prospect,So that's how many hours difference is it? Six and a half hours. Right. 6 hours difference roughly.
9,SDR,Yeah.
9,Prospect,"Okay. On the 14th. So you want a 15-minute slot, right? I could do it on Thursday the 15th."
9,SDR,Okay.
9,Prospect,"Just a second. I'm sorry, man. Just a sec. At 01:00 p.m. New Zealand time."
9,SDR,Perfect..
9,Prospect,"If you can send me a 15-minute appointment, that'll be great. Please."
9,SDR,"Sure, sure. Awesome. So at 1PM New Zealand time. Okay."
9,Prospect,And you can use this as a reference to talk to Murtuza as well. All right. Because I'm just doing this for courtesy to see what you have to present. So I'm not committing to anything.
9,SDR,"Sure, definitely. Will do that. I mean, I'll make sure that reference is involved."
9,Prospect,"Okay, thanks. Take care. I will just share the invite."
10,Prospect,"Hello, this is Mike speaking."
10,SDR,"Hi Mike, good evening. This is Kreena giving you a call from Multiplier. Can I have a quick moment please?"
10,Prospect,You can.
10,SDR,"Wonderful. I noticed that Jacob has the team spread across Asia Pacific and you may not have entities in all of these locations and sometimes it may complicate tasks like payroll management and, you know, making the payments to the employees in their local currency, providing local benefits itself. Would you be open to exploring a solution that takes care of everything when it comes to tax compliance, labor laws, payroll, and benefits for employees that are working from countries where Jacob does not have an entity?"
10,Prospect,"Yeah, I'd be open to exploring. We do already use a couple of companies called Remote and also Bettersource. But we also do have our own company set up in a number of those countries that we work in. So look, we already do have companies we work with, but I am happy to explore other solutions."
10,SDR,"Oh, wonderful. So you mentioned Remote, which was the other one that you mentioned?"
10,Prospect,It's called Bettersource.
10,SDR,Haven't heard of them. But I'm going to do a little more research and be prepared. When can we schedule this call?
10,Prospect,Monday or Wednesday next week would be good. Or Thursday next week.
10,SDR,What time?
10,Prospect,"Look, in the morning is better for me. On Monday I could do any time between 2:30 and 4:30. On Wednesday I can do any time before 1:30 Australian time. And on Thursday I could do any time before 11:00 Australian time."
10,SDR,Wonderful. Let me just check my product team's availability and send out an invite accordingly.
10,Prospect,"Okay, no problems."
10,SDR,Can I confirm your email address as well? It's just loading up one moment.
10,Prospect,That's okay. It'll be my first and last name. Yep.
10,SDR,Wonderful. So I'll send across an invite and let's catch up there then.
10,Prospect,Perfect. Thanks so much. You have a good day.
11,Prospect,Hello.
11,SDR,"Hey, how are you doing?"
11,Prospect,Ahh.. doing well.. who's this?
11,SDR,"Hey, this is Kabir. I'm actually talking from Growfin and we are a customer."
11,Prospect,"Okay, awesome. How you doing today?"
11,SDR,"I'm doing great. You know, I was just on your LinkedIn and I saw your latest post about how you closed 2000 accounts and, you know, how you are so quick when it comes to support. And I just wanted to say, you know, that's actually really true about your company. And, you know, your team is so quick when it comes to support, especially Tammy. You know, whenever a rep joins, like I just joined two weeks ago and she called me like in the first two days and I was like, amazing. So I was just going through your post and resonated with it so much."
11,Prospect,"I really appreciate you reaching out and making the call and letting me know that. That means a lot because like, you know, I've been at this company since we started this and before we had any customers, right? Like I was the fifth employee and the first account executive, and back, you know, five and a half years ago, we didn't have customers, we didn't have money, we didn't have a product. And to hear from a client who just signed up, having a great experience and reaching out personally, man, it means a lot. Thank you."
11,SDR,"Yeah, man, I just wanted to say that. And given that we use your product a lot, it helps us, of course, bring a lot of pipeline. And given that your sales teams are so quick in closing the pipelines and your support teams are so quick when it comes to helping your customers, I was just wondering how your finance teams and sales teams, how quick are they when it comes to solving disputes?"
11,Prospect,"No, that's a great question and I honestly have no idea. Disputes? If I can point you in the right direction, I will. So Cher is our VP of customer success. So that's who you would really want to speak with. And then also Clara, she's involved in support and disputes and resolution as well."
11,SDR,"Got it. Quick question. Given they are involved in disputes, thank you so much for that info. I'd love to reach out to them. Given you're the finance leader and Growfin is a product that basically helps teams collect their revenue, you know, helps collection teams collect the revenue faster, I was wondering if you'd be interested, you know, to come over a call and, you know, just have a chat and look at the product."
11,Prospect,"Yeah. You know what? I take about one call a month. Look, I really couldn't help you because it's not my side of the business. And look, I'll meet with you for 15 minutes if it helps you out just to get a meeting, but you would be talking to the wrong person. So I'm not in charge of disputes and resolutions. Like, that's completely on another side. I'm in charge of like net new revenue driving, retaining revenue. That's more of a, it's just broken down a little bit from there in a different section of the company."
11,SDR,Got it. Got it. Awesome. Right. So I was just wondering who would be the.. So the right person to reach out for collections would be Steff.
11,Prospect,"So there's Steff, she is head of customer success. You might want to connect with Steff, she is who you want to start with."
11,SDR,Got it. So is there any way you can connect me with them on LinkedIn?
11,Prospect,"I'll tell you what I can do. So we generally don't make connections but you're a customer. So I want to help you out as well. I would just reach out to her directly on LinkedIn and connect with her and I would send an email to her, you know, saying how you're a new customer. Basically, you told me you're a new customer. Just like really? I would say email subject lines like, 'awesome, awesome new customer experience. Thank you.' Right. Just say, 'Hey, name over here at company. I just signed up. The first two weeks have been phenomenal.' Give a shout-out to the person who helped you out. And at the end of that, weave in kind of your ask in value props."
11,SDR,"Thank you so much, man. That's super valuable. I think that's something I really need to get coached on. But thank you so much for helping me out there. It's a pleasure. And all I want to say is thank you so much. And yeah, I loved your post. Love what you're making. You know, the content you're making on LinkedIn, I just want to tell you, this is my first cold call."
11,Prospect,"So, yeah, this is the first cold call in your career?"
11,SDR,Yes.
11,Prospect,"Are you serious, man?"
11,SDR,Yeah.
11,Prospect,"This is the best cold call that you could possibly do. Like, really? Because at first, I kind of figured it was a cold call starting off. I didn't recognize the number or the voice, then you mentioned, obviously you're a customer, so now it takes a totally different, you know, tone and then leading with a compliment is like very genuine and you're tagging in like the support and service. So like that was.. you could not have done that any better. I hope you recorded all of it."
11,SDR,"Thanks, man. Yeah, I'm just 21, starting on my career, and, you know, I've started using your product and I just love it. And I just got my first meeting, you know."
11,Prospect,What's your name again?
11,SDR,Kabir. It's K-A-B-I-R. I'm sending you a connection request on LinkedIn right now.
11,Prospect,"Yeah, do it. And then once we get off the phone, text me your full name, first, last name, and your email. Well, I'm going to hook you up, man. First cold call ever, and you just killed it. And you're a customer. So I train sales teams on the side. So I.. uh.. Outside of working hours, I charge between five, $800 an hour to train the sales team. And I'm going to give you 30 minutes of my time and really help you out with some strategies to really help you make some money."
11,SDR,"Thank you so much, man. I can't wait to let my company know about this, you know. Thank you so much. You know, it's been a pleasure talking to you."
11,Prospect,This is like the best call I've gotten in 2023 from a cold call. So you have a very bright future. I'm going to help you make some money and use it in a great way.
11,SDR,Awesome. Awesome. I'll send you a message right away.
11,Prospect,Awesome. We'll see you.
11,SDR,"Cool. Have a nice day, man."
11,Prospect,"Yeah, bye."
12,Prospect,Hello.
12,SDR,"Hi, it's Nathan calling from Hivelocity. Did I perhaps catch you at a good time?"
12,Prospect,"Yeah, actually you got me right between a meeting shockingly."
12,SDR,"Okay, well okay, I'm glad for that. Well I won't take more than 30 seconds. I'll try to not take more than that. The reason I reached out is because I saw you're the IT director for your company and I'm not sure if you ever came across Hivelocity. We are a bare minimum cloud provider, basically providing dedicated bare minimum servers, colocation hosting solutions, and all of that within our 40 plus data centers platform. We do run right now worldwide. More than anything else, I was interested in putting you in a position to gather more information about us and how we're helping our presence in the gaming industry, see how we're working with Unity powering layer AAA publishers, you know, for improved performance, customer reach, cost reduction, and pretty much everything that revolves around that."
12,Prospect,"Sure. So we actually are a co-development studio currently for the most part and don't actually host any of our own online gaming infrastructure, which doesn't mean we won't be in the future, but at this point we are lucky, I would say."
12,SDR,Yeah. Well maybe that can blend in for your internal use. Maybe.
12,Prospect,Possibly. Right now we actually just signed with the local colo place that we're going into here locally in Madison at the moment. But if you want to shoot me some info over I can take a peek and keep you in mind because I have a feeling we will have more needs as we grow.
12,SDR,"Well definitely. That's the reason I think I reached out at a great time in terms of just to spark up some interest. So if you don't mind fitting a couple of minutes maybe you can meet one of my AEs or management team guys. So you just can get into more details and see how, you know, dive deeper into details and see how we especially and exclusively can help maybe in that process of your company growing and all of that."
12,Prospect,"Right at the moment, unfortunately, I am kind of crazy busy. We're in the middle of a couple of projects."
12,SDR,"Like weeks from now, two weeks after now?"
12,Prospect,"Yeah, if you want to talk a couple weeks from now I could probably talk for a little bit."
12,SDR,"Okay, great. I'll try to send you something as a placeholder maybe for the last week of February."
12,Prospect,Okay.
12,SDR,Okay great. What time zone are you right now?
12,Prospect,Central.
12,SDR,Central. Awesome. I have your email here. Your first initial. That's the best email for you?
12,Prospect,Correct.
12,SDR,"Okay, great. I appreciate all of this. I'll try to send you that invite and do a quick check-up to see if everything is all set and Yeah, I mean, we'd love to meet with you."
12,Prospect,Sounds good.
12,SDR,Okay. Have a great rest of the day.
12,Prospect,You too. Bye.
13,Prospect,Hello
13,SDR,Good morning Justin
13,Prospect,May I ask who's calling?
13,SDR,"My name is Sean, I'm calling from Hubilo for Justin."
13,Prospect,How can I help you?
13,SDR,"I see a lot of people from your company engaging with our content that talks around demand generation through webinars. Since you're the marketing manager, I thought you would be the right person to talk about that."
13,Prospect,"uh.. Sure.. yeah, yeah. You… who are you? Are you from Google, did you say?"
13,SDR,"No, no, I'm calling from a company called Hubilo, H-U-B-I-L-O. We are an end-to-end generative AI-based webinar management technology that helps you starting from increasing your attendance in your webinars to going ahead and creating content assets after the webinar is done. Do you guys do webinars at your end?"
13,Prospect,"We do. In fact, I'm about to start one up in about 45 minutes."
13,SDR,"Oh, wow. I wish you all the luck. And if you don't mind me asking, what platform are you using?"
13,Prospect,"We're using GoToWebinar. I actually, I really got to get set up for this webinar. Really trying to get ready for it, but I am interested. I've been trying to look at different solutions to replace GoToWebinar because I'm not very happy with it. But feel free to either call me back or do you have my email?"
13,SDR,Allow me to confirm that. Give me one moment. Give me one second. I'm so sorry about that.
13,Prospect,You're good.
13,SDR,I have it here as your first name dot last name.
13,Prospect,That's correct.
13,SDR,"All right. Would it be overstepping if I, you know, if I send you a couple of links of how we do what we do and how we're better than GoToWebinar along with the tentative calendar for the second week, do you have availability?"
13,Prospect,"Sure, that'll work. Like I said, I've been wanting to make the switch from GoToWebinar, so I'd be interested in hearing what you have. I've done some research and you guys didn't come up in my research, but if you don't mind me asking, how'd you, how'd you get my information?"
13,SDR,"Um, we have a marketing team, uh, that, you know, that has any kind of trigger. So anybody from your company who visits our website, we have an alert that says they're looking for your solution. So. And then it's, it's the sales thing. I looked at LinkedIn as to who's the marketing manager? I found you. I thought I'd give you a call. And here we are. Um, do you have, uh.. Do you have, like, half an hour on the 13th? On 1 PM."
13,Prospect,"Uh, what day?"
13,SDR,"Uh, the 13th. 13th is a Wednesday."
13,Prospect,Of September?
13,SDR,Yes sir.. Yes.
13,Prospect,September 13th at 01:00 p.m. is that central time? Eastern time?
13,SDR,You tell me what works for you.
13,Prospect,"Central time would work perfect, one o'clock for me."
13,SDR,"All right, all right, so give me.. Give me, like, 15-20 minutes. I'll send you a brief email as to what we do, how we're better than GoToWebinar. And I'll send you a calendar invite for the 13th at 01:00 p.m. Central."
13,Prospect,"Okay, sounds good."
13,SDR,Thank you Justin. Thank you so much. You have a good one.
13,Prospect,You too. Bye.
14,SDR,"Hey, this is Ani with Rocket Lane. Can I take 30 seconds to explain why I'm calling you out of the blue? And at the end of that 30 seconds, if it's not relevant, you can just hang up on me. Does that sound okay?"
14,Prospect,Mm hmm.
14,SDR,"Awesome. I appreciate it. I work a lot with your peers in professional services, and they tell me their top priorities this year are to forecast demands across their teams, accurately making sure their PSA and project management tools are talking to each other, and try and hold customers more accountable during delivery so they never miss their deadlines. Do these sound like your priorities today?"
14,Prospect,"They are, yeah."
14,SDR,"Awesome. I love hearing that. Out of the three that I mentioned, does anyone come to top of mind as your top most priority?"
14,Prospect,Forecasting accuracy.
14,SDR,Got it. And what would you say are the sort of challenges right now in your process that's making this a priority for you?
14,Prospect,"Ummm.. Hard to say. If I knew what was causing inaccuracy, I would have fixed them (chuckles)."
14,SDR,"Yeah. And why do you think it's set up that way? I mean, is that more like a consequence of how you've set up your project delivery model in terms of, you know, just walk me through what happens the minute deal closes and your team knows that they've. They've got to sort of get a project started. Are you having trouble staffing that project, or are you having trouble trying to find visibility on which of your engagement managers are ready to take it up? It just stuff like that?"
14,Prospect,"No, it's just predicting the burn rate on our projects."
14,SDR,"Got it. And I'm just trying to guess, what do you think is the KPI or metric that's suffering as a result of this inaccurate forecasting?"
14,Prospect,Ummm… Probablyy.. you know.. just hitting our targets or at least letting our..ahh executives know when we're going to miss our targets. That's the important part.
14,SDR,"Yeah. I'm guessing you folks want to be profitable as a PS org, right? And, hey, you know, just a shot in the dark. You're probably using a PSA tool today, right?"
14,Prospect,"Yes, we are."
14,SDR,Do you think the PSA tool is giving you as much insight into the forecasting bit and the project management bit as it should be?
14,Prospect,"They do a pretty good job, but there's always things that can improve."
14,SDR,Got it. And what would those things be?
14,Prospect,Being able to separate the forecast from the actuals.
14,SDR,"That sounds really interesting. That sounds to me like it's a pretty, you know, it's table stakes in terms of requirements. Do you feel it's in the way you folks have set it up, or do you feel that the tool just doesn't have the capability to show you that?"
14,Prospect,I guess just the way that the tool is designed.
14,SDR,"Got it. And it's probably FinancialForce and Mavenlink or something like that. Hey, you've been very kind in answering all these questions I've thrown at you. Can I tell you what Rocket Lane does real quick without making it a yawn-worthy sales pitch?"
14,Prospect,Sure.
14,SDR,"I appreciate it. So we're basically reinventing the wheel when it comes to customer-facing PSA because we're the only tool in the world that lets you tie together your PSA stuff and your project management stuff all happening out of one tool. So think forecasting, resources, resource management, time sheeting, financials, project burn rates, trying to see if you're profitable as a PS org. All that is tied into your project management itself. And the entire thing is customer-facing from the ground up. So you choose to see what you want customers to see and you hold them accountable during delivery as well. So typically we see PS teams using something like FinancialForce or Mavenlink and trying to make that work together with a Smartsheet. So whenever they have changes in project requirements, they're not able to make that change in their resource plans. And there's a lot of manual work and redundancies going on in the process. We tie that entire experience into one, and I guess the metrics that we'd impact would be better forecasting and making sure PS teams are pulling revenue forward so they can stay profitable. Does any of this resonate with you at all?"
14,Prospect,"It does, yeah. Yeah. The customer-facing portion."
14,SDR,Yeah. So would you be open to spending 20 minutes with me to try and understand how we solve for this and just chat a little bit more about your priorities and see if there's any way we can help out?
14,Prospect,"Yeah, sure. I'd be open to that."
14,SDR,That sounds good. Does tomorrow work for you? Same time tomorrow?
14,Prospect,"Well, actually you caught me at a bad time. I'm getting married, so I'm going to be off tomorrow through July 12, so I'll be back."
14,SDR,"Congratulations. First of all, I think it's a great time. I don't think it's a bad time. You're probably looking forward to that break."
14,Prospect,"Yes, for sure."
14,SDR,"So you said July 12, right? I'm guessing your first week back in is going to be crazy. Yeah, shoot for the afternoon of the 17th, which is the Monday after."
14,Prospect,"Sure. Yeah, we can do that. I got 03:00 p.m. open."
14,SDR,"03:00 p.m. Eastern, right."
14,Prospect,Sorry. 03:00 p.m. Eastern.
14,SDR,"Yeah. 03:00 p.m. Eastern. Sweet. My name is Ani. I'll just shoot you a note on LinkedIn so you can put a face to my name. Hey, congrats on the wedding, man!"
14,Prospect,Thank you.
14,SDR,Awesome. I'll be in touch. Appreciate it.
14,Prospect,All right. Have a good one.
14,SDR,Yeah. See you.
14,Prospect,Bye.
15,SDR,"Hi, this is Sophia calling from Simera."
15,Prospect,"Hi, how are you?"
15,SDR,"I'm good, thank you. How are you?"
15,Prospect,Good. Where are you calling from? Again? I'm sorry.
15,SDR,I'm calling from Simera. I sent you some emails a couple of weeks ago regarding the openings you guys have. The remote opening.
15,Prospect,Which company?
15,SDR,Simera.
15,Prospect,Yeah.. what's.. What's the question?
15,SDR,"So. Well, I'm calling because I wanted to know if you guys are interested in hiring in Latin America."
15,Prospect,Hiring what?
15,SDR,Hiring people in Latin America.
15,Prospect,"Oh, in Latin America. Sorry, which posting are you speaking of?"
15,SDR,"Well, it's specifically for a product manager because I found your page that you were looking for a product manager. But actually, we could, I mean, if we talk and see what your needs are, we can surely look for someone in some other job opening if you guys have."
15,Prospect,"Yeah, so we need.. ummm.. like auhm.. a program manager. But how would that work? I mean, are you saying you would just lease someone for the duration of what we needed? Or do you find full time?"
15,SDR,"Yeah. It works.. Basically, what we do is we have a quick talk, the account executive and our co-founder, for example, with you, and you tell them all the details. What do you need? And the specific job posting that you are looking for. And we send you, like, a couple of resumes so you can see if you like them or not. And, I mean, we do that until you find the perfect fit for your role. But those details, you can talk them over with our co-founder. So maybe we could schedule a 15 minutes meeting if you're interested."
15,Prospect,"Yeah, but how does the compensation go? You find someone and then you're out of the middle. Or are you in the middle the whole time?"
15,SDR,"No, we're in the middle the whole time. I mean, we do everything for you. The payroll, all that. Payroll. The payroll process. The hiring process. I mean, it's really quick, it's cost-effective. It's like from 40% to 60% more cost-effective than hiring without Simera. So I think it would be a good fit for you guys. So we could schedule the meeting if you're interested."
15,Prospect,"No, I know. I just want to make sure we're still trying to build our product. And I appreciate you reaching out. It's just like, for one role, I wish we had a little bit more to do this with because we do have staff augmentation, people coming and going, but I just don't believe in that business model."
15,SDR,"I mean, maybe you could talk to our co-founder and see if you find, like, a fit for that. I mean, he could tell you all the details, like. And I mean, with no compromise at all. I mean, just that 15 minutes meeting and that's it?"
15,Prospect,"Yeah, I can. I can do that. That's fine. Where you.. Where are you located?"
15,SDR,In Boston.
15,Prospect,"Okay, and where's he located?"
15,SDR,What?
15,Prospect,Where's he located?
15,SDR,"In Boston, too."
15,Prospect,In Boston. Okay.
15,SDR,Yeah.
15,Prospect,Yeah.
15,SDR,"So maybe I can.. Yeah, I mean, your email is josh.com, right?"
15,Prospect,Correct.
15,SDR,What time would be good for you? Maybe tomorrow or today.
15,Prospect,Umm.. I could probably do something this afternoon. Today. Tomorrow is pretty bad.
15,SDR,"Okay, so I'll send you one today at four. Would that be good? Or two?"
15,Prospect,I can do five.
15,SDR,"All right, you're located.. What's your time?"
15,Prospect,Umm.. East coast.
15,SDR,"East coast. All right, so I'll send you the email right now with the meeting at five."
15,Prospect,"Okay, that's for the calendar invite, correct?"
15,SDR,Yeah.
15,Prospect,"Okay, cool. And.. Sorry. Your name again?"
15,SDR,Sophia. My name is Sophia.
15,Prospect,Sophia. Got it.
15,SDR,Thank you so much. Have a good day.
15,Prospect,Bye bye.
15,SDR,See you later.
15,Prospect,Bye.
16,SDR,"Hello, am I speaking with Justin?"
16,Prospect,"Yes, speaking."
16,SDR,"My name is Nathan, I'm calling from Hivelocity company. Did I perhaps catch you at a good time?"
16,Prospect,"uhm… Actually I'm about to go to a meeting right now, but what is this call about?"
16,SDR,"Okay, it wouldn't take more than 30 seconds. Yeah, I saw you're a CTO and as I mentioned, Hivelocity. We are a bare metal cloud provider offering different edge compute solutions. We are running a very large bare metal cloud platform with 40 plus sites, compute locations providing hosting, colocation, and bare metal services to thousands of businesses. Just more than anything else, I was interested to know and get more insights on your cloud computing infrastructure efforts. And if I can share some information via email that highlights our value points."
16,Prospect,"Yeah sure, we're just using AWS. Yes. So if you could just send me some information about your infrastructure, I will look into that definitely."
16,SDR,"Okay, great. Actually, I mean using some of the other providers, we definitely expect that as we speak every day with businesses who are using any of the major public clouds. And as I said, just wanted to introduce you to what we're doing, showing you how we're moving or adding to bare metal and how we provide cost reduction, performance improvement, customer reach with our 40 plus edge compute locations. So yeah, I can share that email with you right after this call. Would you probably be open to hearing more about us from our management team on a brief call? Probably anytime you would have next week? Or the week after?"
16,Prospect,Sure.
16,SDR,Okay. Are you in front of your calendar right now or would you like me to propose a time?
16,Prospect,uh.. If you could do this next week on.. uh… next week on Wednesday 11:00 a.m. pacific time.
16,SDR,"11:00 a.m. pacific time. Okay, that works great. I will send that invitation to you. I have here your email. Is that your best email?"
16,Prospect,Yeah.
16,SDR,"Okay, thank you for that. I will send you this information right after this call. Of course, I will describe the topics you want to include in that meeting. Just so I can know that everything is set up, please make sure to accept the invitation."
16,Prospect,Thank you.
16,SDR,Okay. Thank you for your time.
16,Prospect,Thank you.
17,SDR,Hey Justin
17,Prospect,"Hey, can I help you?"
17,SDR,"Yeah, I was just hoping for 30 seconds. This is Skylar with Nooks."
17,Prospect,"Sorry, with who?"
17,SDR,"Yeah, it's a company called Nooks."
17,Prospect,"Sorry, you're breaking up a little bit. I'm also in the basement of uh.. my home, so."
17,SDR,"Yeah, sorry about that. I think I've got bad wifi. So I asked.. I said I saw you were a sales manager. I was curious if you have reps that make cold calls or are they more focused on, like, inbound, like, warm leads and marketing stuff?"
17,Prospect,A bit of both.
17,SDR,"Okay, gotcha. When they make those cold calls, do they have, like, a specific tool they like to use, like LinkedIn, maybe something like that?"
17,Prospect,We're using Orum.
17,SDR,"Okay, gotcha. I'll tell you what Nooks does really quick. Then you can tell me if it's, like, relevant or if I'm just, like, out in left field here. Essentially, Nooks will pull in those call tasks, and it'll let them dial up to five lines at once. So instead of spending 30 seconds listening to that phone ring, it'll only connect them when they get a live prospect. So instead of spending all day for ten convos, they might be able to do that in an hour, and it'll free up some time for personalized outreach, like LinkedIn, email, account research, like, all that good stuff as well. Is that interesting, by any chance?"
17,Prospect,How do you guys compare with Orum.
17,SDR,You said Orum?
17,Prospect,Yeah.
17,SDR,"Yeah I used them for two years, so I think I can answer that pretty well. Biggest difference, number one, is pricing. We're about half the price. We also have the best engineering team I've ever seen, to be honest with you. I used Orum for two years, and they did not have a lot of updates until Nooks came along. And now they're trying to compete pretty heavily and release those updates to maintain that competitiveness. Yeah, we're always releasing new features. We've got the best sales floor right now in the dialer space, and we're priced pretty competitively. Would you be open to taking a look? It's probably easier to show you than just explain it over the phone."
17,Prospect,"I'm not certain whether we're really in a position this year to really invest in some of these tools. So I might suggest, I mean, in terms of timing, probably not this year at all."
17,SDR,"Okay. Two questions. Like, one, would you be open to taking a look just so it's on your radar so that when you do start thinking about those decisions, you know, you have a good idea of what Nooks is like?"
17,Prospect,"I mean, not really a priority for me right now because, I mean, if we're really going to be making an investment in a tool, like, I want to be able to have a budget for it, but I mean, we're, we're talking way too early."
17,SDR,"Sure. And I guess, have you ever had, like, this might be a really weird one-off case, but have you ever been in a situation like, I'm just assuming, but let's say pipeline generation is your priority and there's a tool that can help with that. Would there be a path forward if, like, leadership thought this was like a must to have or would that just still be, like dead on arrival?"
17,Prospect,"I mean, I think that's going to be, like, really difficult to.. It's going to be a challenge to push that up."
17,SDR,So you're saying there's a chance they'd continue with what they're using?
17,Prospect,"I mean, I think if you're going to be selling like any kind of revenue-generating tool, like kind of the answer around that is like, yes. Right. Like you can, you know, is it going to help generate revenue? Absolutely. I think part of this is just, you know, if we already have a pretty solid tool stack, like, what more can this thing actually do that we don't already have the capability of doing? Right? And next to that.. uh.. you know for an organization like us and yours. You want to have the sale? Totally get it. We want to get business done and generate some revenue. Something needs to give there and it boils down to budget."
17,SDR,"Yeah, I single dialed in for probably six months or so. And typically when teams switch from single dialing to using a dialer, they'll see a four to five times increase in productivity, which ultimately does result in a decent amount if your AEs are doing well. ARR on the back end there. So it is a big game changer for a lot of teams because right now those convos can be hard to come by."
17,Prospect,"Yeah, I mean, the only thing I can tell you that may be a challenge for us with.. I mean, we're using Orum and uh.. their dialer is just simply.. uh, what is it.. uh.. their local area dial.. I'm going to make a guess that you guys also have something that's a local area dial."
17,SDR,"So we let you pick up to five phone numbers, and if one gets marked as spam, we tell you you can switch it out. So, you know, I've got, with 4 or 5, it works pretty well for me. I've got like a ten to 12% connect rate with that. But some people, you know, two or six, I've heard, does really well. You can kind of play around with that to see what works best for your prospects and your team."
17,Prospect,And how does.. how does the number actually get.. uh..  I mean.. uh..  how do we actually know whether the number gets marked as spam or not?
17,SDR,"Yeah, so we go through Twilio and they report it to us. And from what I've seen, it seems pretty real time. I had a prospect once. He was one of those directors of sales that just doesn't like cold calls, I guess. And he got kind of angry and said, I'm going to report you to spam. And within two minutes, it was marked as spam in Nooks. And I deleted that phone number and changed it out."
17,Prospect,"Yeah. So, umm.. I mean, Orum is using Twilio as well.. umm. But it sounds like you guys have a way of taking a look to see the phone numbers that are used or purchased, which ones have been marked as spam. Is that something that end users can actually pick up on and see, or is that like an internal tool.. uh.. for your engineering team?"
17,SDR,"No. So you guys, we want you to be able to see that directly. We want you to have as much success as possible. So if you're calling with bad phone numbers, that's bad for us. We want you to get those connections and those pickups. I know you mentioned timing is kind of tough, but I could show you these things. We only have to do a full 30 minutes. We could do like 15 minutes. If that's something you're open to."
17,Prospect,"Let me do this.. uuhm.. I mean.. uuhm.. Shoot me an email. I happen to be like right in front of my inbox. You could probably see me open it. But uh..  if you don't mind, I'm going to share this internally with a couple of other BDR managers and just get their input on it. Even though we don't have budget. I mean, my.. my take on it is.. uuhm my take on it is. uh. I mean, in order for us to be able to roll something like this out, uuhm.. I mean, budget definitely needs to come from our execs. uhm.. That's going to be the major hang up and challenge for us, uuhm.. the other end of it is.. uhm.. just implementation because our.. uhm.. our team is pretty tight on just implementation. And so I don't know if this is going to be something like, you know, I'll give you an example of, like, Salesforce. Uuhm.. You can buy Salesforce, but Salesforce is not responsible for implementation or integrations. Right. We have to either do that ourselves or we have to hire third-party consultants to do that for us. So I don't know if that's going to be the same for your system."
17,SDR,"Yeah so Nooks is really smooth, actually, with integrations. So, number one, to prove out like a POC with leadership, we've got a two-week free trial with an ROI calculator. Our account executives are really hands-on with the trial. It's just a click of a button. Like, we just pull in those call tasks and then you've got them in Nooks. Usually it takes, we block off 30 minutes. Usually it takes five minutes to get that integration set up so we don't make you do that on your end."
17,Prospect,"uhm.. Two weeks? Do.. do you guys pilot for a longer period of time? And I'm going to make the assumption that if you guys do pilot, you guys want a contract in place."
17,SDR,"No. So it's a free trial, no contract in place. That two weeks is flexible. Like, if for some reason, let's say you've got bad data quality and you need to fix it, whatever reason it is, our founders usually work with people and they'll approve an extension if necessary. We've got one pretty big enterprise customer right now that's about to close, who's been in trial for probably two months or so because they had a really big team and it's taken some time to get them all onboarded. But, yeah, we make exceptions on a case by case basis."
17,Prospect,Okay. So where are you based?
17,SDR,So we're most of the team is in San Francisco. I'm in Denver. We have a guy who used to live in Toronto. He'll go back there occasionally. We've got some east coast people as well.
17,Prospect,Yeah. uhm.. How long have you guys been in business for?
17,SDR,"So we started in 2020, same time a lot of the dialers kind of took off. There's one that started in 2019. I think there's some that have been around a little longer, but that are more legacy and kind of outdated. Yeah, pretty much. Since 2020, though, we've been growing pretty quickly. Over 100 customers. We might be getting close to 2 million ARR."
17,Prospect,Yeah. Okay. Uuh.. If you don't mind. Shoot… uuh.. If you can shoot me an email. I'm just uh.. right in front of my inbox. And then.. uhm what's.. what's your role at the company?
17,SDR,So I'm a senior SDR. So lots of cold calling and list building. I kind of help build out those outbound processes and I do take some demo and disco calls now and then.
17,Prospect,Are you working off of any of those tools internally?
17,SDR,"Yeah, so I use LinkedIn."
17,Prospect,"Yeah. Okay. If you happen to be in Denver. Okay. I'm looking at my calendar right now. I'm willing to put in the time, just like my time personally in just taking a look at what the tool does.. uuh.. before I have this kind of put in front of all the other BDR managers. uhm.. What's your.. what's your timing like on this Friday at uh.. 8:30?"
17,SDR,Would that be eastern time?
17,Prospect,uhm.. Pacific standard time?
17,SDR,"So just one second, I'm just pulling up my calendar here. Yeah, I've got that open. That's perfect."
17,Prospect,"Yeah. Okay. If you want to shoot me uhm.. a calendar invitation for 30 minutes. uhm… 8:30. Actually, you know what, make it eight if that's okay."
17,SDR,"Yeah, that's perfect. That's fine."
17,Prospect,Okay.
17,SDR,And is your email the same.
17,Prospect,Yeah.
17,SDR,"Okay, awesome. So I'll get that calendar invite sent out. It might put it in spam just because Google's doing this thing first. Calendar invites, sometimes it's sending them to spam if you haven't communicated before, but otherwise it'll be in your inbox or your spam. And then I look forward to chatting with you on Friday at 8, Pacific."
17,Prospect,"Okay, that sounds great."
17,SDR,"Hey, thanks for taking my call man. I appreciate it."
17,Prospect,"Yeah, you're welcome."
18,SDR,"Hi, how are you? This is Andrea from Simera."
18,Prospect,"Oh, hi. Hi. How are you?"
18,SDR,"I'm good, thank you. I was wondering if you guys were in need of any remote workers. We have the candidates for that."
18,Prospect,What kind of remote workers?
18,SDR,"So basically we offer US companies and Canadian companies remote workers from Latin America. They speak full English and they're fully vetted and qualified for different types of roles. So we can even save up on payroll, and we handle all of the legal, like the legal part of it. So if you are ever interested, then I did send you an email."
18,Prospect,"Well, I'd like to know. Well, you guys give me some types of skill sets you're referring to. Give me some more details."
18,SDR,"It depends. So what we do is that, for example, if you tell me you need sales agents, for example, we look for the best sales agents for you guys. Depends on your job description. So we do match them. We have an AI verification."
18,Prospect,"How can you get like.. So for example, let me give you an example. I have some software, I'm in the insurtech business, life insurance, very specialized insurance technology for life insurance. Okay. And we have some software solutions that we resell to life insurance carriers. Right. And the idea is not to, is for those sales agents or whatever to actually get a meeting scheduled. But if you don't know the business or you don't have a relationship, it's going to be very difficult to do those kind of sales calls. So I'm not sure if, I'm just trying to figure out how are you going to help me? You see, you understand what I'm trying.."
18,SDR,"So I understand what you mean. However, I believe that if you hire anyone, like at all for that position, you will kind of have to give some training to them on the industry, the specific industry that you're in."
18,Prospect,"Oh, I have no problem with.. No problem with the training that's yet. Training. No problem. My question is, is that I don't know if they can, you know, the kind of people or senior people they need to contact. How are they going to be able to, if they don't, if these people don't have a relationship or they're not well known, how are they going to be able to get those people to interact with them so they can give them the sales pitch and then schedule a demo. Right? That would be the objective. And then after they schedule the demo, they finish. That's all the job is. Right? Yeah, but the problem is that.. But they have to be able to.. So it's very difficult, unless that's what I'm saying. So without the relationship or the contacts that would be able to do that. Yeah."
18,SDR,"Okay. I understand. So just how we do it here in Simera. I work in sales, as you can see. We do the research, we do the process."
18,Prospect,You want to spell for me?
18,SDR,"Yeah. Correct. This is a sales call, basically. So basically we do all the prospecting, the right research and stuff for the people that potentially be interested."
18,Prospect,"Yeah, this is a little bit more than prospecting. It's more about.. It's a little bit of qualifying. I mean, enough to make sure that they're.. Get them excited to want to see because the value is so big, or we know that they're actively looking for a particular type of software solution and to get the right person. And then they need to be able to, when we say prospecting, they have to be able to reach out to some key people. I don't know. I mean, maybe you guys are very effective in that. I don't know, but.. And then what do you charge for that? I mean, how does that work?"
18,SDR,"Well, we do have a Simera fee, but we can present to you the candidates before you don't. You don't have to pay for anything until you decide to hire someone. We do have different types of fees."
18,Prospect,"If we hire someone, what does that cost? How does that work?"
18,SDR,"I believe the fee for Simera is $2500. I believe it depends on the candidate and it depends on how many you got. But let me tell you something. I work in sales, so I'm not the right person like to talk to about this. So how about I set you up with my co-founder for ten minutes and he can explain to you every single thing."
18,Prospect,Let me see your website. How do you spell the name of your website?
18,SDR,S-I-M-E-R-A
18,Prospect,Dot com?
18,SDR,"Simera dot I-O, I-O."
18,Prospect,"I-O, Okay. It didn't work. F-I-N-E-R-E? Maybe I did it wrong."
18,SDR,"No. Simera, A at the end."
18,Prospect,A.
18,SDR,Yes.
18,Prospect,Okay. A. I got it. It still didn't come out. F-I-N-E-R-A? Right?
18,SDR,S as in snake.
18,Prospect,"Oh, S is the first letter."
18,SDR,"Yeah, S-I-M. M as in Mary. S-I-M-E-R-A."
18,Prospect,S-I-M-E-R-A dot I-O?
18,SDR,Correct.
18,Prospect,Here we go. Simera.
18,SDR,Yeah.
18,Prospect,"And then where? Okay, let's see. Hire talent. Let's see what kind of.. And then sales. IT. Administrative customer service marketing. See, I may need some IT help, but what if it's just part-time or for, I mean, how does it.. What's the commitment?"
18,SDR,"Well, the commitment is like we cater to the company's needs. So you tell us what you exactly need. If you need full-time, you need part-time. We usually go for full-time. However, it totally depends on you. And that depends on what you need."
18,Prospect,Yeah I need to know the pricing and what you guys can do. And who are some.. Do you have any references? Like who are some of your clients?
18,SDR,Should I send all of that through email? And should I also set you up for next week for ten minutes? No more than that. For a Zoom call?
18,Prospect,"You can set, you can, you can step.. Yeah. Business development represent in Latin America. Sounds amazing. Are these testimonials or what?"
18,SDR,"Already like saving a lot on like the payroll itself. People are still earning good because they're in Latin America, but you are still saving up, like for US standards. Right. So the Simera fee that comes whenever you hire someone."
18,Prospect,"Yeah, but I also can get people, I have 150 developer, software engineers that I contract in India."
18,SDR,"Yeah, correct."
18,Prospect,Okay. They're cheaper than Latin America.
18,SDR,"Sometimes, yeah. Sometimes, yes. Although the quality of the work, it can be like discussed as well. It's kind of different as well. We are on your time zone, for example."
18,Prospect,"I need IT help, but I don't need engineers. I have all that I need like somebody to help with, you know, setting up like email accounts and some infrastructure type things in the cloud."
18,SDR,And we have all of those candidates available.
18,Prospect,"We actually work with.. a lot of companies like you guys too, but yeah, let's go ahead. You want to send me an invite? I'll tell you, I got my calendar in front of me. Send me an invite."
18,SDR,What time are you available next week?
18,Prospect,"Well, let's pick a day. Let's look at Wednesday."
18,SDR,Wednesday. All right.
18,Prospect,"And I'm on Eastern time, so if you want to do like 2 eastern time."
18,SDR,"Two eastern time, all right, I'm going to send you an email. Is your email the same?"
18,Prospect,That is correct.
18,SDR,"All right. I'm going to send you an email right now with the, our cost charts. It doesn't really matter, although, because you are going to speak with my co-founder later, but you can still take a look at it and I'm going to send you my one pager as well."
18,Prospect,"That sounds good. All right, sounds good. I'll look out for your email. Thank you."
18,SDR,Thank you so much for your time. Have a good weekend.
18,Prospect,You too. Bye.
19,SDR,Hey. Hi. Good afternoon. This is Majid with Engagedly. How are you doing?
19,Prospect,"I'm good, how are you?"
19,SDR,"I am also great. Thanks so much for asking. Well, firstly, appreciate you picking up the call. I'll be honest, this is a cold call. We have never spoken before, but I was curious if I could have 40 seconds today to explain why I was keen to talking to you?"
19,Prospect,Sure.
19,SDR,"Well, thanks so much. And at any point of time, you know, if you feel I'm being irrelevant, let me know. I'll drop off the call there. Actually, I was, you know, talking to a couple of leaders from the human resource space that are, you know, from organizations similar to yours. And they tell me that because of the decreasing rates of employee retention, they are seeing an, you know, increased need to take people enablement initiatives that could help improve on employee productivity and engagement. So I was just curious to get in touch and see if this is relevant in your world currently."
19,Prospect,"You know, we're pretty small, but we're fully remote."
19,SDR,Right.
19,Prospect,"So I think for us, you know, collectively as an entire organization, it's hard to engage as a team. I think the departments do a good job of engagement with each other just because they have weekly meetings and just doing their day-to-day stuff. But as a whole organization, I think we are lacking. And part of that is just due to the fact that we are all remote."
19,SDR,"I mean, totally understand that. Like, is it safe to conclude that when it comes to, you know, engagement on the part of the organization, have you, since you mentioned that you are kind of lagging on initiatives there, have you tried to solve that? Or, you know, is that not a priority or you're focusing on something else currently?"
19,Prospect,"uhm.. it is on the list and, uuhm.. you know, definitely something that I would like to tackle the second half of this year. Uuhm.. You know, I'm rebuilding our HRS system and almost complete with that and, uuhm.. you know, we're building a new ERP system. So there's lots of moving parts right now, but it's definitely something I need to tackle just based on, you know, employer retention and making sure that people feel wanted and cared for."
19,SDR,"Absolutely. I mean, totally agree on that. Well, how about performance management processes, like is that automated for your team currently or, you know, you're employing excel and other things all doing, you know, manually?"
19,Prospect,"I built out the performance review November of 2022. It was prior to that on paper. So that actually has been checked off. I think we need to do a better job of being specific about roles with performance reviews because it's very generic right now. So there's still some work to be done. But as far as making it automated and having a tracking system and it's all paperless and in the cloud, that's a bonus."
19,SDR,"I mean, great to know that. How about if I say that, you know, as I mentioned, I work for this company called Engagedly and we specifically tackle these two particular things, automating and digitizing performance management and employee engagement processes. Now, the reason that I wanted to talk to you is that I have been, you know, researching your organization and knew that you guys are completely remote and that similar organizations are facing, you know, these sorts of difficulties. So would it make sense for us to, you know, set some 20 or 30 minutes for maybe this week or early next, depending on your availability, so that we can show you around as to what we do, what, you know, Engagedly as a platform is all about and how we have been helping similar teams?"
19,Prospect,"Sure. Towards the end of next week is better. I. Well, that's Thursday or Friday."
19,SDR,"Well, sounds great. So we are talking about.. Let's, let's go with Thursday. Would that be okay?"
19,Prospect,Let me look real quick. Thursday is the 11th. Yes. I only have one meeting on the books and it's 930 to 1030 central.
19,SDR,Right. And you are in central time just confirming that. Correct?
19,Prospect,Correct.
19,SDR,Awesome. So how about we do it at 01:00 p.m. central time on Thursday?
19,Prospect,That works for me.
19,SDR,"Sounds great. I just wanted to confirm the email ID where, you know, I would be sending across a calendar invite so that, you know, we have something on the calendar. So is it your first name last name dot com?"
19,Prospect,That'S correct.
19,SDR,"Awesome. Thanks so much. I'll send across the calendar invite and, you know, a small email giving the details and setting a kind of an agenda for the call. In the meantime, if you need any more information before the call, you know, or have any specific answers that you want to be, specific questions that you want to be answered, feel free to shoot an email and would love to talk on those."
19,Prospect,"Okay, perfect. I look forward to it."
19,SDR,Awesome. We look forward and I'll be sending across a calendar invite in the next couple of minutes and I.. Yeah. Looking forward to speaking next week then.
19,Prospect,Thank you.
19,SDR,Thank you again. Have a wonderful day. Bye bye.
19,Prospect,You too. Bye.
20,SDR,"Hi, Anthony."
20,Prospect,Hi there.
20,SDR,"Hi. This is Chris here with Allego. Appreciate my interruption to your Friday afternoon. I hope you might have a quick moment. Let you know why I wanted to give you a call, but keep it brief."
20,Prospect,"Yeah, go for it, mate. No problem."
20,SDR,"Alright, so I've been speaking to other sort of sales and commercial leaders recently and more than anything, there's been one problem they've been facing and that's what they're coming to us to help solve. I wanted to see if this might be relevant to you. The average deal is now involving six or more people and lasting several months, so getting a consensus from everyone is a bit of a challenge. And what's happening is seemingly kind of positive looking opps are losing steam, dropping off the pipeline entirely, or being pushed forward into Q2, Q3 because it is so difficult to get that connection in a virtual world. I wanted to see how you're making sure that you're engaging with your prospects when you're only really with them for such a small part of the buying cycle."
20,Prospect,"Interesting question, as I've got a bit of time. Happy to talk to you today. I've only got five minutes there to give you that."
20,SDR,Appreciate it.
20,Prospect,"Well, we just talk to them. Just set up meetings and talk to them via teams normally, and then if they're interested in being in person. Yeah, if they're interested in meeting person then we meet in person. But the deals we do are quite large, so there's not like, you know, a load of them going on at once. So it might be different. Depends on what you offer."
20,SDR,"Yeah, no, of course, I understand. We say kind of, you know, you have the.. have the calls on teams or in person, I guess. How do you kind of, you know, keep things ticking over when you're not in person or when you've, you know, hung up from the team's call?"
20,Prospect,"Yeah, just follow up via email, really. Thanks for the call, pleasantry, that kind of stuff."
20,SDR,"Appreciate it. Bit of context then who I am and why I'm calling. Appreciate you said you got a couple of minutes, so I've got kind of little flavor. So my company, Allego, what we do is, so, first of all, we're a sales enablement platform, but we wear a few different hats in that space. But I was coming at you today with the way a lot of people in, you know, like you said, you haven't got too many deals going on in a year so they could be quite chunky and they come to us with ways of being able to kind of share the right content with the right stakeholders and be able to kind of.. They can't track who is engaging with what content so they don't know what content is resonating and they don't know who the right kind of people are. If anyone is extra is being brought into the sales cycle a bit later on. If content's being shared kind of behind the scenes, that side of things. How do you work with, you know, new stakeholders coming in or stakeholders changing? You find that happens a lot."
20,Prospect,On the customer side?
20,SDR,"Yeah. On the customer side, yeah. So when you're kind of in terms of your prospects."
20,Prospect,"Uuh.. yeah.. new people arrive and disappear quite often in the NHS. So yes, it's regular."
20,SDR,"I've got an idea, not at the scale that you are, but I've, in a previous life I've sold into the NHS, so I feel your pain. I know what you're up against, different scale, but yeah, more into the estates department for me in the past, but yeah, I'm with you. Cards on the table. What I'm doing here is we've got a way of enabling folks like yourselves to stay front of mind with your prospects throughout the buying cycle, pre, during and post-sale. That allows you to share the right content, share the video calls that you're on, and crucially, kind of communicate through this platform asynchronously. So it's not just an email thread and you can kind of use this. We call it a digital sales room, if you've heard of the term at all or the concept effectively it's like a little microsite between you and your prospects for each deal and all the relevant situation, all the relevant information is kept there and, you know, you can kind of use that as your kind of go-to place. You can track the content, see who shared it, see who's used it. It informs you because you know what content's resonating and what's not. Just wondering, appreciate it's a Friday afternoon. Would that be something that you might be open to maybe 20-30 minutes next week? Have a quick exploration on, see if it's something that could be useful to you?"
20,Prospect,"I think, uuh.. yeah, if I'm being honest, maybe unlikely, but as you've come across quite well, I'm happy to listen and take a look, but I don't want to set any expectation, that's all. So, uuh.. yeah, it's unlikely, is my gut feel, but happy to give you the time of day and take a look and give you some feedback if that's of use. But I don't want to set any expectations."
20,SDR,"You're cool, you can explore, you know. Best case, yeah, we can help. Worst case, you know, you know who we are. You've learned a little something and we can, you know, share what other people in the field are doing, you know. So there's no, no pressure or big ask on this one. When would you be free? Next week. Appreciate. It's only four days next week, isn't it?"
20,Prospect,"Yeah. What I'd like to do. If I share my email and you email me, then I'll get our PA to book a slot in the probably 20-25 minutes or something like that. uh.. I'm happy to do that in a nice way as it's a Friday and you caught me at a good time. I get a lot of calls, as you can imagine, and I never normally do this but I don't know why I am on this occasion. I think you've come across quite well and obviously I'm in sales so I know it's difficult so I'm happy to spend 20 minutes with you, so if I give you my email address there, you want to just drop me an email? I've got to go on a call. Of course, do. So I need to give it to you now. So it's my first name last name at company dot com."
20,SDR,Lovely. I'll send a quick email across now and then we'll get some timing.
20,Prospect,"Yeah, we'll get it scheduled and if it's not next week then middle of next month but I'll have my PA sort it."
20,SDR,"Lovely. Appreciate that. Thank you very much. Hopefully it'll be useful and. Yeah, enjoy your weekend. Long weekend. Speak to you soon."
20,Prospect,"Thanks, bye."
21,SDR,"Hey, this is Jake giving you a call back from usergems. Do you have a second or did I catch you in a meeting again?"
21,Prospect,"uh.. I have an interview at 4 o'clock but I don't have a phone call yet, so you've got me until that phone call comes in."
21,SDR,"Okay, super quick question. So I know you're the VP of sales over at your company and I was just wondering since about 30% of people are changing jobs this year, what's your team currently doing to take advantage of this job movement to generate like new pipeline and revenue?"
21,Prospect,uhm… I'm not sure I understand the question.
21,SDR,Yeah.
21,Prospect,So you mean like prospects changing jobs?
21,SDR,"Yeah, or like past buyers or champions moving from a customer account to one of your target accounts? Is that something your reps are tracking and following up with them?"
21,Prospect,"No, it's very tricky.. other than manually.. I understand the concept. Very difficult to, very difficult to track. Unless that's probably where you're going to tell me you can help."
21,SDR,"That was a bit of a loaded question, but yeah, we're a tool that directly integrates with your CRM to automatically track that and then you can completely automate this process. You can either have your reps like manually reach out with customized things or put them into a marketing sequence to be like, hey Bob, you worked with us at company A, Congrats on the new role. Do you think it makes sense to bring us along to company B? Did I explain that in a way it makes sense?"
21,Prospect,"Yeah. So with one minor important detail and you can tell me if you can solve this problem. So in my system I have a prospect at a certain company and he used to be, well, I don't know. Right. He maybe is still with the same company.. maybe he's not. And I want to sell him something. And then in all reality, although I might not know it, he's moved to, you know.. another company. Now I can manually see that maybe through LinkedIn, but I, in my CRM system all I have is his previous company. It has no clue that he's left. It has no clue what the new contact information is. Are you telling me that you can look at our database in Salesforce and say, oh, we can automatically tell you that so and so person is no longer at company A. And here is their new company abc.com and his new email address is this. Can you do that?"
21,SDR,"You basically just did my pitch for me. So yeah, we just need the original email address, first and last name, our database or our back end scrubs LinkedIn every month, updates with their new company, new email, phone number, everything like that. And creates a new contact and links the two marking the original one is no longer at company or at a date. Or you could just have it replace the original, depending on how you want to configure it. Yeah. Does exactly what you just laid out automatically every month. Yeah."
21,Prospect,You have my interest.
21,SDR,"Okay, that's good to hear. Yeah. So would you be interested in, like, talking more about this? I know if you have an interview coming up, so don't want to dig too into it. Do you have your calendar in front of you by any chance?"
21,Prospect,I do.
21,SDR,"Do you have any? Let me look at availability for next week. But, yeah, you literally did my pitch for me, so that was, that rarely happens."
21,Prospect,"Tuesday, 01:00 p.m. eastern to 02:30 p.m. any chance that's available?"
21,SDR,"Okay, let me take a look."
21,Prospect,"Actually, hold on. I'm looking at the wrong date. My apologies. Tuesday, middle part of the day is pretty open."
21,SDR,"Okay. So is there a time that, like, works best in there? I should be able to work around your schedule."
21,Prospect,"Oh, let's say 11:00 a.m. eastern."
21,SDR,"11:00 a.m. eastern on Tuesday. Okay. Oh, I'm on the wrong week. I'm in April. So this would be the 28th. 28th at 11:00 Eastern, yes. Should be able to make that work. I want to make sure I have your email address correct here. Is it just a first initial, last name at company dot.com?"
21,Prospect,Yep.
21,SDR,"Okay. Yeah. So can I just send over the calendar invite, and we can dig into it more then?"
21,Prospect,Absolutely.
21,SDR,"Well, thank you so much. Yeah. I'm really excited to have this talk, and hopefully we can work something out."
21,Prospect,Awesome. I appreciate it. Have a good weekend.
21,SDR,Yeah. Good luck with your interview.
21,Prospect,"All right, thanks. Bye."
22,SDR,"Hey, this is Ani with Rocket Lane. Can I take 30 seconds to explain why I'm calling? And at the end of that, if it's not relevant, you can hang up. Does that sound okay?"
22,Prospect,Sure.
22,SDR,"Awesome. Appreciate it. I work a lot with professional services leaders in your space and they've been trying to reduce project timelines, increase visibility for internal teams and customers, and try and turn a profit on every project their teams are running. I'm curious, are these priorities for you folks today?"
22,Prospect,"They are, but it also sounds a lot like our own pitch."
22,SDR,"Yeah, no, well, it is my way of getting around there. But hey, I'll save you a sales pitch and just tell you real quick about Rocket Lane through one of our customers. Does that sound okay?"
22,Prospect,Sure.
22,SDR,"Okay. So you've heard of Clari, I presume?"
22,Prospect,"Let me just change my bluetooth. Where we live right now, the power went out, so I'm actually in the public area with everybody else. Let me just put my bluetooth headphones on. I'll be able to hear you better. Hold on."
22,SDR,"Oh, yeah, sure."
22,Prospect,Okay. Can you hear me?
22,SDR,"Yeah, loud and clear. Can you hear me?"
22,Prospect,"Yep, it's much better."
22,SDR,"Sweet. I'll keep this quick. You've heard of Clari, I presume?"
22,Prospect,Clarity. Yes.
22,SDR,Clari. Clari.
22,Prospect,Revenue platform.
22,SDR,"Yep, yep, that's the one."
22,Prospect,"I don't know if I have, but not to say that I have it, but I uh.. I have heard it up now."
22,SDR,"Yeah, no, no worries. So they're basically super high growth startup that is now a really mature startup, I guess, but they're one of our biggest customers in the US. So their PS teams are having real trouble reducing time to value and just making sure that their projects are getting completed on time and that they're maintaining like a positive ROI on the top line for their PS team, especially because they were taking on projects at a really high velocity. We worked with them and just helped them reduce that time to value and enable them to get more projects out the door quicker and maintain like, a positive ROI in terms of their billable utilization and how they're delivering their projects. I'm curious, what do you think the business impact would be for you folks if we could do the same for your business?"
22,Prospect,"Well, yeah, I mean, I'm all ears. But our platform though, that what we do is supposed to be like. Well, I mean, it's a little bit different with a low-code, no-code area, but what we do.. but our whole pitch is like time to value, to uuhm..  implement solutions based upon our low-code, no-code solutions. But yours is more about methodology projects."
22,SDR,"Exactly. It's more of a project management tool that was sort of purpose-built to deliver customer-facing projects. So most PS teams today, they're, they're repurposing generic project management tools like asana, spreadsheets, slack, and stuff like that. Or they're using legacy PSA tools like Maimon Link Financial force, which often do way more than what's required. Yeah. So we're kind of at that intersection."
22,Prospect,Okay
22,SDR,"Sorry, go ahead."
22,Prospect,No no.. Go ahead.
22,SDR,"Yeah, no, I was going to say we're at that intersection where we're sort of purpose. We're sort of creating and pioneering this space of customer-facing project management. And we're super purpose-built for PS teams and implementation teams because we've got a customer-facing site to Rocket Lane, which enables your customers to see the same things that your team does effectively. So, you know, everyone's on the same page, everyone's accountable, and you're able to just cycle through projects real quick and deliver them in a much better way."
22,Prospect,"Got it. Okay. So are you, you said you're with Rocket Lane."
22,SDR,"Yeah, that's right. Are you perhaps in front of your laptop or something?"
22,Prospect,"I am. I pulled it up. So, like, I, I've been so a couple of things. I'm going to be just totally transparent upfront. Like we, our company just recently went through like two months ago, like a small rift, so we got rid of some of folks and so we're not in buying mode right now, but we are focusing like, like everybody else is. We're kind of like retooling and make sure that we're basically being lean and we're doing things efficiently. And I know it's also kind of our pitch software for the customers that we serve, but we, I have been in conversations with some companies. So we kind of like, we build stuff internally to kind of eat our own dog food, but there was a few things where we just didn't do. And so when it led to conversation with Financial Force about resource management and really just skills and availability instead of PS, but to your point, where they had a lot of stuff that we didn't necessarily need. Yep. So I tell you the same thing. Kind of funny. Like they. I was just, I guess the last time I talked to him, I said, like Adela Tickler saying like, hey, this is not the time. Like, you know, call me, you know. Anyway, they just called me because I guess the timeframe came up and I just let them know the same thing as like, hey, I, you need to push it out a month because I did bring up their concept just like two weeks ago in the conversation. So we are just in the phases of trying to figure out if we are going to use our own resources to build internally or if we're going to go do kind of exactly what you're talking about. So I feel like we're like the cobbler's children. We have the product that we basically, service is a low-code, no-code solution that allows us to build applications faster and deliver for very large, you know, large and small customers. So a lot of times I, especially on the service side, I feel like I'm prone to trying to say we should eat your own dog food and build something that, you know, that we can turn around. But also at the same time, I realized a lot of times we don't have the timeframe to do it or the resources ourselves. So that's why last time Financial Force kind of approached me, I was able, it just happened to be that someone else had mentioned their name. And so looking at the company and I said, oh, your name just came up. So I took the meeting. I don't know, rocket lane. Not saying that I should not take a look at it."
22,SDR,"Yeah, fair enough."
22,Prospect,"Kevin, I see that you have plenty of awards."
22,SDR,"Yeah, that's true. We are sort of reinventing the wheel when it comes to this category because there truly isn't a tool out there that does customer-facing project management. And that's the thing with Financial Force too. Right. We hear that a lot. We've got quite a few customers come over to us from them, purely because there's not, it doesn't tie up that customer-facing project management experience along with timesheeting, resource management, and global utilization all built into the same platform. Now I get that those might not all be priorities for you, but given, given you are sort of open to taking a look, do you think we should set up 30 minutes just to understand how we're doing things, see if there's any pain we can solve and we'll take it from there, you know, no pressure. Not trying to get you to rip up what you guys have and get you to commit to anything."
22,Prospect,"No, no, I, you have my attention, especially if I just feel like I'm going to talk to those guys in a month. There is somebody else. There are two people I should pull into. Yeah, let's go ahead. So I'm just going to let you know that. I'll tell you, you got me. I'm down for like, getting a demo and finding time. It's not going to be. Well, you know.. It's not going to be this week anyway. This is our annual review process timeframe for the people that I want to get involved in are busy writing annual reviews for the year, so I would let me get my calendar in front of me. I'm pulling up a couple of other resources here that I think.. to make it a meaningful meeting.. you want the same people in the same position I am.. that are all influencers. We'll leave our boss out for now. We'll tell him about it later."
22,SDR,"Yeah, absolutely. That would be help."
22,Prospect,"Okay, so next Wednesday on the 22nd."
22,SDR,"Yeah, perfect."
22,Prospect,"I have. We have 11:30 to twelve and there's people that are all from east coast, but that'll work. So I'm going to give you my email and then I will send it to the two of them. I'm going to put a placeholder right now for those folks. Grab their calendar."
22,SDR,"Yeah, for sure. Hey, just to make this easier, do you just want my email and you can send it across the three of us and I can get people from my side on the invite and tie it all up. Great. So my email is. Let me know if you're ready. Yep."
22,Prospect,"Yep. Hold on a second. Okay, I'm ready."
22,SDR,Yeah. Sweet. It's my name at company dot com.
22,Prospect,Yeah see your photo.
22,SDR,Sweet. Funny story. We have a couple of unease in the office. So it gets really. It gets really messy when we're trying to book a calendar. So I'm glad that you could see a photo. I'm just going to hang on till you hit send and I can see it just to be sure.
22,Prospect,"Okay, I'm about to hit send. Hold on. Inviting external folks.. sent."
22,SDR,"Yeah. All right. Just 30 seconds while I'm refreshing like a madman over here. All right, I see it."
22,Prospect,"All right, awesome."
22,SDR,"Appreciate it. I'll make sure. Yeah. Thank you. To be honest, this has made my day to just so you know, from like an honest salesperson speaking, this made my day. You're a great prospect. So I appreciate it."
22,Prospect,"Yeah, no, it's kind of like timing, right? It was. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely. Just. Just so you know, like, I mean, I. Total transparency, there's no guarantees. I don't know when we're going to do anything, but we are talking about trying to increase internal processes. We're actually having meetings now about trying to build our own internal stuff using your own dog food. But we're also, there's just certain things that we don't do. And each one of us that are on the invite, they're all in the same positions, but in different, like, they lead to different organizations at the side of PS. And the problem, each of us are coming to it with our own little angst. So the part that, for me, selfishly I like, the one thing I liked about that Financial Force that we didn't have internally in our own product was I have a team of people that report to me, but each of them have different specialties and kind of like what they're specializing in. And so when projects come up, I'm always interested in knowing kind of like, the availability of people who have those skills and that kind of stuff. So that way I can basically see resource management on, like, this person has, you know, like 20 hours a week available during this timeframe and also gives me the ability to assign the type of skills that an individual has. So that way I can also put it on their IDP or their individual development plan. So that way they can actually. I can basically have them get skilled up in new areas. Now, the other folks that are on there, that's important to them, but they all have something different as well. I'm not saying that you should hear the presentation towards what I just kind of said. You should do your normal spiel because you'll then hear from the other folks what was important to them because theirs' bit different from what I just kind of have."
22,SDR,"Yeah. Hundred percent. Yeah, no worries. This does help a great deal, even if it's just getting your side of the story. And, yeah, we'll make sure that we're just touching all areas and trying to see if there is some pain there that we can help solve, and we'll take it from there. No pressure. We're not trying to get you to commit."
22,Prospect,"All right, cool."
22,SDR,Awesome.
22,Prospect,"Well done, sir. Have a good one. Bye."
23,SDR,Hey Anthony
23,Prospect,Yes
23,SDR,"Hi, my name is Sumawa. I know I'm calling out of the blue here, but is this a good time? This is a cold call sir."
23,Prospect,uh.. I give you.. uh.. Can you do it in three minutes?
23,SDR,"Less than that. I was going through the services of your company, and I was hoping to get your opinion on a couple of things about the firm. So I thought of reaching out, and I see that you're the director of global strategic relationships. Just for me to be relevant here, sir, does staffing recruitments or staffing augmentation fall under your purview, or is there somebody else that takes care of it?"
23,Prospect,"We work with a guy by the name of Blake. He's a recruiter. He uses Indeed, I think is the name of his firm."
23,SDR,"Okay. Okay. A lot of firms that we work in the industry, sir.. We've seen that there are multiple staffing vendors for their staffing requirements. Is that how it works at your firm as well? Or does mister Blake attend to all your staffing requirements?"
23,Prospect,"No. We are a multibillion dollar firm spread across 160 offices in 20 countries. I work for the asset management division. There is this little guy who specifically handles us, but the other 50 I'm just not familiar with."
23,SDR,"Okay. Would it be overstepping if I want to show you what we bring on the table and see if at all there's a possibility of collaboration? Anytime next week, whenever you have ten to 15 minutes."
23,Prospect,"I would tell you I'm not the one who would make the decision on it. I could probably get you to the decision maker if you want to send me a one pager or something like that. And if there's enough there, then certainly I'd be open to a phone call subsequent to having something tangible."
23,SDR,"Sure, I'd love to do that, sir, but, you know, instead of, I will go ahead and send you a white paper, but alongside, is it okay if I send you a tentative 15 minutes calendar for Wednesday? So the reason why I say that is because I'd be able to explain better when I'm talking instead of a long email. So 15-20 minutes Wednesday or Thursday, whichever is convenient for you."
23,Prospect,"All right, so let's look.. umm.. I have got .. umm.. looks like ten or eleven on the 15th, or you can, and these are all Pacific, or you can have 12 o'clock on 16th."
23,SDR,"Okay, so 11:00 a.m. pacific on the 15th works for you, right?"
23,Prospect,Yes.
23,SDR,"Okay. And I have your email here as first name, last name is that, correct?"
23,Prospect,"No, it's my initial, my last name at company dot com."
23,SDR,"Allow me to repeat that for you, sir. It's your initial, last name at company dot com."
23,Prospect,Correct.
23,SDR,All right. Thank you so much for taking the time. I will go ahead and send you a white paper and invite link. I'll see you on Wednesday at twelve PST.
23,Prospect,"All right, go get them."
24,SDR,"Hey, this is Colin over at Humantic. We've actually never spoken before. It's my first time giving you a call here, but you have a moment so I can tell you exactly why I'm calling you today."
24,Prospect,Sure
24,SDR,Yeah. So the reason I'm reaching out is really to introduce Humantic to you when I'm not calling you out of the blue. Have you ever heard of us before?
24,Prospect,No.
24,SDR,"Yeah. So what we do is we help sales teams further personalize the entire sales process by leveraging personality insights. What's your team doing today in order to collect research and have information to personalize, whether it's top of funnel or even be like, before discovery and demos?"
24,Prospect,"Well, they're using LinkedIn Sales Navigator and ZoomInfo."
24,SDR,"Got it. So, yeah, that gives you some pretty good information between LinkedIn and ZoomInfo, but we actually take it like, a step further. So we're giving you insights into the actual person around their personality, what matters most to them, traps to avoid, you know.. communication styles and preferences.. things that can really move the needle in building rapport and relationships with your buyers. Is that something you'd be open to chatting a bit more about maybe in the next week or two?"
24,Prospect,"Not really. I mean, no. We're doing so much from a macro level through partners that I just. I don't see that being a good fit."
24,SDR,So you're saying most of your business comes through partners?
24,Prospect,Yes.
24,SDR,"Okay. And so do you have, like, an outbound strategy of developing more partner relationships?"
24,Prospect,"We do through our partner teams, yeah."
24,SDR,"Got it. So is most of your business, like, all channel through partners, or do you do any direct?"
24,Prospect,"I would do some direct, but it's a very small portion."
24,SDR,"Okay. So is most of the selling, like, recruiting more partners then."
24,Prospect,"For. Yeah, for our channels and alliances team, yeah, we also have a, we have a, you know, we have a parent company, a very large parent company. So we have a team focused on alliances with that group as well."
24,SDR,"So then once partners get you into a deal, then is your direct sales team working those deals, or does the partner work those deals all the way to close."
24,Prospect,No the partner works those deals.
24,SDR,"Yeah, got it. And then. But you have, like, a sales team that supports them throughout the sales process, or how does it work?"
24,Prospect,"Yeah, we have reps that align with our partners."
24,SDR,"Got it. And do you think it'd be beneficial if when a partner brought you a deal and you have particular prospect, large deal online, maybe multiple stakeholders involved in the buying process, having insights into those people, what matters most, how their communication styles and preferences. Do you think that would be important?"
24,Prospect,"I don't know. I think it's, like I said, I think it's a little more of a direct model than we're running here."
24,SDR,"Yeah, I mean, some people think that they only use it in like top of funnel outbound, but it works really well of, you know, getting into discovery, running a personalized, you know, demonstration or presentation and even, you know, moving stuck deals. Do you guys ever have deals that get stuck?"
24,Prospect,"Sure. So you presented it differently. So how does it work if you're, you know, in a pursuit and you'll stuck? Tell me about that."
24,SDR,"Yeah, so a couple of things, right. So, you know, we integrate with all of the tools that you probably use today, your CRM, sales engagement, anything like that. And then we can give you insights into your buyers or your prospects about the things that matter most to them and traps to avoid and what their communication styles and preferences are. So sometimes if you hit some of those hot buttons that you shouldn't, that's enough to get a deal stuck. For example, some people are more relationship driven people, so focusing on that and throughout the sales process is going to be more important to get that into the win column. Other people, not so much, not, the relationships don't matter, but they might just really be a more ROI driven person. And so having those sort of insights of knowing how you structure the deals and the talk tracks throughout the buying process or what can help to, you know, move deals forward and also get deals, you know, moving forward that are stuck. So I don't want to get too deep into the weeds. I'm pretty confident that we can add some value to you and your team. We didn't spend a ton of time together, but if we spent like 15-20 minutes in the next week or two, I could potentially make some good recommendations and tell you if it's something I think could actually move the needle for you or not."
24,Prospect,"Yeah. So, yeah, I'm kind of newer with the group. I've been here just a few months and I'm working on helping them figure out how to build relationships across the organization with multiple contact points. I think what you're talking about is helpful. Unfortunately, I think maturity wise we're probably a year away from it."
24,SDR,"Yeah, well, I know, you know, end of year stuff is probably pretty busy. I wouldn't want to even, you know, maybe get something on the calendar."
24,Prospect,"No, I'm not talking about that. I'm saying seriously, I mean, we are developing a direct business unit and trying to help them build relationships directly. But again, the level of maturity you're talking about, we're a long ways away from that."
24,SDR,"Yeah, I mean, I still feel like there might be a use case in the current business model. I don't want to be too pushy or anything like that, but if you could spare me 20 minutes on your calendar, maybe some first or second week of January, and I could just spend a little bit more time understanding how you guys are operating today, I think I could make a pretty good case for how this could help you guys achieve some of those goals."
24,Prospect,Sure. I'll give you 20 minutes in January.
24,SDR,All right. First week or second week work better for you?
24,Prospect,Let's see. Probably first week actually.
24,SDR,So second and third is pretty open.
24,Prospect,"Are you. Yeah, second, I think will be out, so."
24,SDR,"Yeah. Well, I mean the second or 3 January either."
24,Prospect,How about the fourth? Wednesday?
24,SDR,"Fourth. All right. Your pacific time zone, right?"
24,Prospect,"I'm in mountain, but close enough."
24,SDR,Okay. So I could do like 01:00 your time. Would that work?
24,Prospect,That would work.
24,SDR,Okay. All right. And what's the best email for you?
24,Prospect,First name last name at company dot com
24,SDR,"Oh, got it. Okay. All right, awesome. I will send that across right now and I'll talk to you on the fourth at 01:00 p.m. okay."
24,Prospect,And you said it was Humantic?
24,SDR,"Yeah, Humantic AI. I'll send you a bit of information, you know, before we meet. And that way you have some things to kind of, you know, understand, you know, what, what it is we're trying to help you accomplish here."
24,Prospect,"Okay, sounds good."
25,SDR,"Joe? Hi, yes. Hey, it's Thomas. I have a quick question for you, if you could help me out for a second."
25,Prospect,You're Thomas whom?
25,SDR,"Thomas Wrestler. I'm seeing that you're the lab support principal engineer at your company. My question for you is, does that mean you work directly with network devices like switches, routers, firewalls?"
25,Prospect,"I do. And I'm sorry, can you please explain who you are a little bit more?"
25,SDR,"Yeah, yeah, of course. So, yeah, here's why I'm calling and asking. I'm with IP fabric. Essentially, we just released a self-guided demo of our platform. It's point and click. We help automate manual processes involved in troubleshooting and documentation, especially in a multi-vendor environment. Would love for you to take a look at the platform. Not asking for anything here, just any feedback, if you have any."
25,Prospect,"Okay, well, I think I saw an email associated with that. I had no idea if that was real or imagined or what the situation is. To be perfectly honest with you, I think it's still in my deleted. I can possibly take a look at that and see what the heck it is."
25,SDR,"Yeah, of course. Yeah. I actually didn't send you the link over to the demo. I just was asking in that email if you'd like to check it out. Essentially, what we do is we discover and document your entire network regardless of what vendor you are. And we're talking switches, routers, firewalls, load balancers, essentially to allow for faster troubleshooting, config verification, and automation and more."
25,Prospect,How does that differentiate from a product like ManageEngine?
25,SDR,"Like, okay, so for instance, with ManageEngine your deployment is going to take much longer and you're going to need more resources to be involved in to keep it going. And you have to have like a predetermined list of what your devices are in the network, and if you miss something, then it won't be in the system. So we essentially discover every single network device in your network, regardless of what vendor it is based on how we do our discovery. And. Yeah, so it's essentially, you could look at it as similar to them, but every time we've gone up against ManageEngine, we've won simply because of what we're able to do in the way that we're doing it."
25,Prospect,"Okay, so why don't you send me a link to your demo and I'll take a peek at that I presently use ManageEngine for some of my stuff. So that's why I asked a question in that particular one. And uh.. it's going to, uuh.. you know.. I've got a good handle on the features and how I leverage those features, etcetera. So umm.. I could possibly ask some additional questions of you. And then I'm just going to be straight up right now with you. What type of price range are you looking at? This is based on per node? Is this based on per individual that's looking at this particular product?"
25,SDR,"Yeah, it's per device. And everyone on your team is able to access it, whether they're on the security team, the network team, if they're in DevOps, everyone's able to access it and will be able to read the same information. So it's just based on device, we've been told in the past that we are about three times less expensive than ManageEngine, but able to deliver more, especially right out of the box."
25,Prospect,"Send me a link to the demo and I will have to take a look at that. Can't make any guarantees, things of that nature."
25,SDR,"Absolutely no worries at all. Just looking for your feedback here, especially if you are using ManageEngine right now. I'll just ask one last question and then I'll send over the link to the demo. How do you like ManageEngine?"
25,Prospect,"It does some really, really snazzy things. There is a lot of bells and whistles, knobs, etcetera. But some of the basics that I use it for is clearly going to be the mapping inventory. Their one IP table is fantastic. Lets me get away with doing a lot of really cool stuff in that department. We have not integrated it with any of our additional systems as of yet for ticket generation, etc."
25,SDR,"Okay. So is it, would that be like simpler?"
25,Prospect,Something in that line?
25,SDR,"Something in that line? Okay. Of course, yeah. So, yeah, we're definitely able to do all that and more. I think you'll definitely find this super interesting. Do you mind if I give you a ring, say, next week to see if what you're thinking?"
25,Prospect,"Yep, that's fine."
25,SDR,"Okay, perfect. The same time on Thursday next week work for you?"
25,Prospect,Sure. Your name was once again?
25,SDR,"Yeah, I'm Thomas."
25,Prospect,"Thomas. Okay, Thomas. Do you have a last name?"
25,SDR,"Yeah, Thomas Wrestler with IP fabric."
25,Prospect,"Okay. All right, sounds good. We'll talk again next week."
25,SDR,"All right, thank you. Yeah, I'll send you over a calendar invite, so you know I'm calling and I'll send you over that. I'll send you over the demo right now, as well as a little bit of features on ManageEngine versus IP fabric as well."
25,Prospect,Okay. Sounds good.
26,Prospect,Hey
26,SDR,Hello?
26,Prospect,Yes?
26,SDR,Hi this is Nathan calling from collective. Did I perhaps catch you in a good time?
26,Prospect,From who?
26,SDR,"I'm calling from a company named Collectiv. Actually, I was having some conversations with director of budgetary planning at your company. So basically I was trying to introduce collective, as we do consulting services, and during conversation they mentioned that pretty much your department workload of financial reporting and that you guys might be open to hear new ideas on how to streamline daily operations. And she referenced and recommended that you or the new CFO might be the right people to discuss this."
26,Prospect,"Yeah, it probably will be a few weeks before we can talk about anything like that because we're right in the middle of our budget of season."
26,SDR,"Well, definitely."
26,Prospect,"Yeah, it's kind of like All hands on deck right now. So we are going to be evaluating doing something like that in the near future, but probably not for another six weeks until we get the budget done. So if you want to reach back out, that would be fine. Or if you want to send me some information, that would be fine as well. I just don't have any time to really entertain this at this time."
26,SDR,"Yeah, well, I'd be happy, definitely, to share some information."
26,Prospect,"But I'm definitely interested, in talking to you about this, but I just, like I said, it's just not a good time right now."
26,SDR,"Yeah, yeah. Pretty much everything is hectic around everything. Well, I'd be happy to share some information with you just so you can have that on your inbox. But instead of me, like, trying to reach out and take this from the scratch, maybe I can send some invitation for, like, as you see, in like, six weeks from now, just so we can put something in the calendar beforehand, and then we can just do follow up. Just make sure we all set for that chat."
26,Prospect,"Yeah, that's fine. You know, I need to talk to my CFO and see what, you know, what his thought is about what he wants to do in this area. He's new to the company, so that's why I'm having to help him so much with the budget. But, yeah, I'll have a conversation with him. But, yeah, if you want to send me an invite, that's, that's fine."
26,SDR,I appreciate that. I have your email here. Name? Last name at company dot com?
26,Prospect,Yes.
26,SDR,"Okay, great. Which time zone. Are you. Are you in Texas Central?"
26,Prospect,Central
26,SDR,Perfect. What do you prefer most? Just so I can. Morning or afternoon?
26,Prospect,It doesn't matter.
26,SDR,"Oh, okay, great. I'll send something on the calendar like that. And, you know, we're looking very forward to the chance to talk to you."
26,Prospect,"Okay. All right, well, I appreciate you reaching out."
26,SDR,"Yeah, definitely. Have a great time."
26,Prospect,"Okay, bye."
27,Prospect,Hi
27,SDR,Hey there. Am I speaking to mister Justin.
27,Prospect,Yes
27,SDR,"Hi there Justin. My name is Arvind. I'm calling you from a software company called Elevate. We are into sales commission automation. Now, the reason I reached out to you Justin, because I was on LinkedIn a while back, and I noticed that you have a fairly large sales team of about 100 folks and you're also growing. Now, I was just a little curious to know that, you know, given the scale of your sales team currently and the kind of hierarchies and probably compensation rules in place, is there any central tool that you have to manage commissions currently? Is that. I mean, is that. Do you face any pain point in that area at all?"
27,Prospect,"No, there's no centralized tool. And yes, it is a pain point."
27,SDR,"Okay, perfect. All right Justin. What we do is we help automate your sales commissions, which means. Right, from managing your commissions all the way to payouts, everything is done very seamlessly. Now, how do you currently manage your commissions? Is that through spreadsheets?"
27,Prospect,Yes.
27,SDR,"Okay. Okay, great. So most of the clients that we work with also sort of manage it with spreadsheets, but what they realize is as the team starts growing and expanding, it starts to get a little tedious. There's a load on the finance team as well as whoever handles sales operations. So, you know, I'll just cut to the chase. Is this something that you'll be interested in? I'd love to walk you through our platform for about ten to 15 minutes if you have a free slot sometime this week."
27,Prospect,"I can't do this week. I could do next week, but, yes, it would be of interest."
27,SDR,"All right, perfect. What day next week works? I'll send you an invite right away."
27,Prospect,Yeah..I'll just look at my calendar here.
27,SDR,"Oh, okay. All right."
27,Prospect,Monday or Wednesday is good.
27,SDR,"Monday. Okay, Monday, Wednesday. And what time? does the same time work?"
27,Prospect,"Yes, that should be fine."
27,SDR,"This time is okay. All right. All right, I'll do that. I'll be sending you an invite shortly. Look forward to running you through the platform. Before we cut the call, I just have a couple of questions. Was I right when I said that? I mean, based on LinkedIn, it says your sales team has about 100 folks. Is the ballpark figure about that much?"
27,Prospect,"Yeah, it's probably about that. Not all of them will be commissioned, but it's probably about that."
27,SDR,"Okay. Okay. Is there any kind of. So currently, where do you store all your deal related data? Do you have a centralized CRM in place?"
27,Prospect,Uuh.. Yes.
27,SDR,Which one would that be? It'll just help me prepare for the demo. A little better… you know I can make it more relevant to you.
27,Prospect,So it's our own ERP system.
27,SDR,Okay. You have an internal ERP system?
27,Prospect,Yeah.
27,SDR,"All right. So we'll have to figure out the integration bit because what we usually do is we. So there's two kinds of data that we need to fetch to automate commissions. One is the deal related data, and one is if you have some kind of an invoicing or accounting tool. Basically because some companies tend to incentivize their salespeople on invoices collected or when the invoices realize or the payment comes in. Some companies also do it on booking meetings. Right. So we usually integrate with both the systems. Do you have any accounting tool in place where all invoice related data is stored? Currently?"
27,Prospect,Yes.
27,SDR,And which one would that be?
27,Prospect,It would be the same ERP system.
27,SDR,"Or the same ERP system. All right. Okay. So we'll have to. We'll have to maybe during our call, sort of discuss as to how, you know, we're going to go about integrating this. Do you have any APIs for this ERP system?"
27,Prospect,Yes.
27,SDR,"Okay, perfect. That should solve the problem. I think I've got all the information I need. It was great talking to you. Have a great week. We'll connect next week on the call. I'll send an email shortly."
27,Prospect,Cheers. Bye.
28,Prospect,Hi
28,SDR,"Hey, this is Ashley calling with second nature. I'm going to be honest with you, this is a cold call. Can I have 30 seconds of your time or would you like to hang up?"
28,Prospect,"Well, my inclination is to hang up, but you got 30 seconds."
28,SDR,"Okay, I'll be quick. So I typically get invited by sales enablement teams that are frustrated that they don't have enough personal time for new hires during the onboarding process or they don't know where to focus the little time coaching that they do have to make the most impact or they can't measure the impact of their training programs. If you could change any of these, what would it be? Is that a good one?"
28,Prospect,"So it was, it was good because it started out with a good open question. So I teach, I run our global value selling program. So good introduction, really like the technique. Now let's dispense with this. Umm.. What does your product do?"
28,SDR,"Okay, so for training we can provide scalability. We've certified 1500 sellers in 30 minutes and there's no other solution that can do that. And Jenny is an immersive simulation so your sales reps can practice with her on the fly even if it's ten minutes a day. So it's like muscle memory. They get to practice and practice and practice. They're scored and they can do it on their own time. They're scored and the information…."
28,Prospect,"Okay. Okay. Timeout, timeout, timeout, timeout."
28,SDR,Yes.
28,Prospect,This is an application platform in the cloud.
28,SDR,"Oops, I'm sorry."
28,Prospect,"So this is an application runs in the cloud, correct?"
28,SDR,"I am. Honestly. That's a great question. I don't believe that it runs. She is an AI, so she learns as you go. And what we do is either you can create your own simulations or we could have our team of experts. What they do is actually you let them know your training process and your company messaging and they build her that way so she'll actually ask you questions."
28,Prospect,Are you a platform? Are you a service? Are you an application?
28,SDR,"Yes, we're SaaS. Yes, yes. So it's in the cloud."
28,Prospect,"Yeah. Okay. Okay, so you're SaaS. Okay. Do you connect into a content learning management system or are you a platform."
28,SDR,"Okay, okay. What we do. Oops, I'm sorry. Go ahead."
28,Prospect,"Okay. So as the customer, you want to keep me talking. So a couple things here. A couple things. Okay. So this provides e-learning modules or this provides simulations? And these are built either by your customers or by your team."
28,SDR,"That's correct. And we can integrate. If you do have a current LMS system, that's not a problem. So we compliment that because we put the end user in the actual situation. So basically, the way to look at it. So imagine the sellers ingest all the learning content in your LMS system and then uses second nature as a way to do the practical training. It's like the LMS is like school. Second nature is like the field trip, interactive, and it's a replica situation."
28,Prospect,"Okay, so you're all about simulations? Yes?"
28,SDR,"Yes, yes. And we can also do webcam recordings as well. If there's any new messaging that needs to be rolled out. One of our clients actually used us at their SKO, and so everybody was aligned on all the company messaging. You can run it as a gamification as well."
28,Prospect,How big is your company right now?
28,SDR,"We have about 200. 200 employees, and we do work with large companies as well. Zoom, Twilio, checkpoint."
28,Prospect,"Sorry, you totally broke up. I was. I was driving over a bridge. So who are the companies that you work with? You work with Checkpoint. Who else?"
28,SDR,"Checkpoint, Zoominfo, Twilio, SAP, Lookout, and that's just to name a few."
28,Prospect,Okay. And those are all enterprise customers or they're just playing with your product for free?
28,SDR,"Oh, no, those are all enterprise customers. Or actually, Zoom has Jenny, what we call our AI, on their org chart. So they're actually the ones that trained over 1600 reps on their new Zoom story, which was competitive position."
28,Prospect,How are you used with Twilio?
28,SDR,"So Twilio that's one of our largest companies. They're the ones that use this for their SKO, and they set up a training. Within 72 hours, we had 1300 sales reps certified. And their challenge was getting sellers trained for selling individual products to a suite. And they also knew positioning around their acquisition."
28,Prospect,"Okay, so here's the deal. This is what I'd like you to send me. You piqued my interest."
28,SDR,"Well, thank you."
28,Prospect,"So Rhea is the head of enablement over at our company. I know her really well. I worked with her for a number of years over at our company. So this is what you can send to my corporate email. Let me give that to you. It's my first name at company dot com, okay. Want to know the companies you're working with, want to know the specifics around Twilio and want links that shows either a YouTube or a video, how your stuff works. I promise I'll check it out. Because one of the things that I'm always focused on is muscle memory around the value selling methodology and building simulations. Doing a ton of that work right now. And if your product can help. I'd be certainly, you know, I'd want to run that kind of up the black hole in my organization because I think it's an area that we struggle with. I am a minute away from Microsoft headquarters. I'm going to be working with them on some CRM solutions."
28,SDR,We're actually speaking with them as well.
28,Prospect,"Awesome. So if you go ahead and send that to me, I will definitely check it out. Please feel free to follow up with me if you don't hear from me within a week. I definitely have interest in something like that. It just kind of depends on how it's all being used and deployments and all that good stuff. How does that sound?"
28,SDR,"That sounds really well, actually. I am not the account executive. That's Michael. So I'm going to run all of this by him as well. And that way I make sure I get you all the information."
28,Prospect,Do me a big favor. Don't make Michael call me again.
28,SDR,I won't let Michael call you.
28,Prospect,"Have him send me the information that I requested, and I will take a look at it. And we'll just get right to the heart of the matter whether or not we can use it. And I would be willing to entertain a call with Michael after I respond to the email letting you know what I think from my perspective."
28,SDR,"Okay, that sounds good to me. I have all this noted, and I will get with him and we'll get that right over to you."
28,Prospect,"All right. Hey, great intro, by the way. I love that \"
28,SDR,"Well, that came from myself. So I'm going to pat myself on the back for that one."
28,Prospect,"I love it. I love it. It's very fair and it empowers your caller, believe me. You got too many SDRs. Just kind of jumping into spiel. That was great. All right, I do have to run. Thank you. I look forward to that email. I definitely will check it out because I am interested in this area."
28,SDR,"Okay, that sounds great. I'll get this over. And thank you so much for all that feedback as well. You just made my day."
28,Prospect,"Awesome, awesome. Keep at it. You know what the next rule is?"
28,SDR,What's that?
28,Prospect,Got to strike. You got to strike while the iron is hot. So you just had a successful call. Go make another one.
28,SDR,I'm keeping it going.
28,Prospect,Have a wonderful day.
28,SDR,All right. Thank you. Bye.
29,SDR,"Hi, this is Dom calling from Cognism. How's your day going?"
29,Prospect,Pretty good. What's going on?
29,SDR,"It's good to hear. Yeah, I know. I'm probably catching you out of the blue this morning. Just wondering if you had 20 seconds I could tell you why I was reaching out."
29,Prospect,Sure.
29,SDR,"Awesome. Yeah, so the reason why I was giving you a call is because here at Cognism, we work with a lot of sales and business development leaders like yourself to provide you guys with validated mobile contact data for your prospects. As you know, a lot more people have been working from home these days. So business development leaders have actually noticed a drop-off in connections and gaps in mobile coverage. I was just calling to see what kind of process you and your team had in place for when you don't have, like, the full contact data for your most important leads."
29,Prospect,"I'm not one that would be in charge of that, but I can maybe at least direct someone to you. Well, hold on a second. Let me get pen and paper here. Wasn't at my computer."
29,SDR,"No, no worries."
29,Prospect,What's a good contact for you? I can maybe put somebody in touch with you here.
29,SDR,"Well, I mean, generally, you know, I'd like to talk to somebody who's closer to the user end side of the situation. You know, I noticed on LinkedIn you were business development manager, so I assumed you'd be using, you know, these tools in your day-to-day basis. By any chance? You know, are you using any zoom info or Lusha in your day-to-day operations?"
29,Prospect,"We use. Are you talking about, like, Zoom meetings? So, like, we use Microsoft Teams? Is that. If that's what you're referring to?"
29,SDR,"Oh, no, I'm actually talking about, like, a data provider, like a sales intelligence tool."
29,Prospect,"Oh, yeah. We use what? We use Sherpa for our CRM and then we resell Konica printing equipment. So we deal with Konica, who has phone systems and everything like that that we use."
29,SDR,Okay. So you're already probably getting your contact data for leads and stuff through them?
29,Prospect,Yes.
29,SDR,"Okay. And by any chance, you know, when. When you don't have, let's say, a valid phone number for one of your contacts or leads that came in? What's typically the route you go through to try to extract that information?"
29,Prospect,"We've got.. uh.. We've got a couple different things, but we rely on our CRM system a lot for that. And then our sales people that are out in the field putting the right information into the system."
29,SDR,"Got it. Okay. Yeah. And by any chance those people on the sale? I'm sorry, those people on the field, are those just regular reps or they, you know, VPs or sales directors?"
29,Prospect,"Really, all of the above. I mean, we've got our, you know, up-and-down-the-street reps and then our major account reps and then the management team that would be all out in the field with those guys."
29,SDR,"Okay, yeah, that makes sense. But by any chance, are you having a team that has lead generation abilities that are actively sourcing the correct and accurate mobile numbers and direct dials and emails for all your contacts?"
29,Prospect,"I don't know what we use, but in terms of getting the correct contacts, we've got a system that pulls up our lease information and competitive lease information and then basically gives us that account. I don't know that it necessarily gives us the contact info, though."
29,SDR,"Yeah, so, I mean, Cognism, just to give a little background, and I'm being pretty vague right now, but Cognism pretty much is just like one of those platforms, except we do help with the account by giving you the list of accounts, but we also give you the titles and industries that you would want to be pinpointing. And let's just say, you know, you want a John Smith that, you know, and you don't have their mobile number or their direct. We actually go out and human verify that on demand for you within 48 hours. That's pretty much what we do here at Cognism, is we just equip sales teams with more accurate mobile phone data as well as emails and directs because those have been, you know, valuable in the past. By any chance, you know, would you be interested in getting a free data sample from us and then you can kind of compare your coverage with ours?"
29,Prospect,"Umm.. Yeah, that, I mean that.. uh.. you can send that to me directly and I can get with our team and see on the back end because I don't, I don't handle that part of it. But, uuhm… yeah, I can get with our team and say, hey, does this make any sense to check into? I'm happy to do that."
29,SDR,"Yeah. By any chance, would you have like 15 minutes we can throw on the calendar for this week and we can meet with one of our data specialists? They're the ones that take care of the whole data extraction on the platform and they'll have more of, like in detail conversation with you about the titles. You're trying to pinpoint the industries, what kind of verticals are working, that type of stuff."
29,Prospect,"Yeah, that's fine. I can, I can do a 15-minute call sometime this week."
29,SDR,All right. Would tomorrow work for you?
29,Prospect,Tomorrow is not going to be good. I'm pretty busy tomorrow.
29,SDR,All right. Are you in eastern time by any chance?
29,Prospect,Yes.
29,SDR,"Okay, so let's see here. Would, would 11:00 a.m. on Wednesday be all right for you?"
29,Prospect,"Yeah, give me a second. I'm jumping into my calendar."
29,SDR,No worries. Take your time.
29,Prospect,"Wednesday at eleven? Yeah, that's fine. Yep."
29,SDR,"Awesome. Yeah, I'll put you in for Wednesday at eleven and we'll have a more enriched discussion then. But is there any other information that you want me to jot down the notes just so we can make sure we use the best use of your time?"
29,Prospect,"No, I don't think I have anything specific. Do you have my email address?"
29,SDR,Then the one I have on file right now is first name at company dot com.
29,Prospect,"Yep, that's it."
29,SDR,Awesome. Great. Yep. I'll send you that email next few minutes here for the confirmation and I look forward to talking.
29,Prospect,Cool. Sounds good.
29,SDR,Appreciate it. All right. Have a good one. Bye.
30,SDR,"Hey Wade, it's Steve Richard from ExecVision. How's it going?"
30,Prospect,"Hey, I'm good, and yourself?"
30,SDR,"Yeah, I'm doing well. Hey, I'm on a recorded line is that all right?"
30,Prospect,Uh.. you're recording this right now?
30,SDR,That's right.
30,Prospect,"Uh.. yeah, sure. I have no issue with that."
30,SDR,"I appreciate that. So my understanding is you're a commercial sales manager, right? And you're overseeing the commercial team in that segment?"
30,Prospect,"That is correct, yes."
30,SDR,"Okay, very good, and uh.. how many.. how many reps you're totally overseeing in your organization?"
30,Prospect,How many.. say that again… you broke up in there.
30,SDR,How many reps uh in your organization in total?
30,Prospect,"uh.. that varies. uh.. good days, it's around 12. It just depends on who's in the office, who's out in the field."
30,SDR,"Oh I hear you.. yeah.. You're in Houston, right? I hope everything's going to get a little bit more back to normal there."
30,Prospect,"Oh, everything's been back to normal, yes."
30,SDR,"Very good.. very good. Well, hey, the reason I'm calling is, umm, you know, a lot of folks that I'm working with right now are kind of in this new world, as everything that's shaken up in sales. They're trying to turn to their call recordings for the purposes of driving consistency in their team.. uh.. are you doing any recording of either calls or maybe online meetings, your zooms, your teams, those kinds of things?"
30,Prospect,"uh.. Yes, I record every single one of my zoom meetings and save them in files. My team is set up to do that through Microsoft Teams and at the same time we do have the capabilities to record our own calls."
30,SDR,"Phenomenal okay very good so you're very bought into this, you're trying to drive consistency, get people doing their calls in a similar way, right?"
30,Prospect,Correct.
30,SDR,"Very good. So one of the challenges I mean in terms of kind of crawl, walk, running, it sounds like you're walking very well, one of the things that people say is they're looking for the opportunity to take that to the next level to really bring forward much more sophisticated call libraries and then also take advantage of uh transcription – \"
30,Prospect,"Uh, you're.. you're kind of cutting in and out unfortunately, you said could I be able to do a call for what?"
30,SDR,"To see how some of your peers are using this kind of what's called conversation intelligence at other companies. I can walk you through what folks are doing and how you could take your game to, you know, really a good place to even the next level."
30,Prospect,"Umm.. I honestly think we're okay for right now. We're currently looking at alternate CRM systems that'll hopefully enhance uh some of the people that within our team to get things out faster, talk to customers a little more consistently and training and everything but yeah for right now we're just trying to implement that system and I think we're okay for right now."
30,SDR,What uh.. what CRM are you on today?
30,Prospect,"Uh we just utilize an internal system we use Sage, we have Microsoft Teams, we have a couple of different systems umm.. but looking at other ones that we're going to be utilizing for project management for customer service or customer relations management uhm.. you know a couple of different systems that we're evaluating."
30,SDR,"Interesting so funny enough uh.. Sage Intact, I mean they're really more of like a financial system but Sage Intact is one of our customers. So they use, they use ExecVision all the time and just I think I kind of misspoke before we're not a CRM but rather it's transcription and it's the ability to use call recordings for training and coaching to help the reps get better because you know I heard what you said about using your recordings of Microsoft Teams meetings but the challenge with that is like nobody has an hour to sit there and listen minute for a minute uh.. this is all about how do you pinpoint just the focus area and look I totally get that you're not in a buying mode right now, if you're open to leaving commerce off the table, I think if you saw this and were introduced to this topic, to this idea, I think it would you know, it'd probably help you a ton as you're looking forward for your team."
30,Prospect,"uh.. absolutely, I understand. It's just that yeah right now we're not necessarily in that in that mode. We're just we're incredibly busy right now, will tell you that to where it'd even be put on kind of the back burner but uh for that matter it's something that we're not actually, you know turned off from entirely, it's just right now it's not that the time for us by any means."
30,SDR,"Yeah just a bit a bit too busy at the time? I.. I get it. uuhm so let me.. let me ask you this, you know uh obviously like you're sales rep, so I wouldn't be doing a good job if I didn't try again and didn't try for that third time and look we can keep it brief we can keep it to a 20 minute and really serve as a resource for you uh for example we have a really good guide to how to create a call coaching culture and some time saving methods when using recording, so you know I would.. I would just set expectations we'd be doing this with you Wade and give you a lot of value for that time and then after that certainly if nothing came of it for many months that's okay. So what what.. what would you say we give a shot for that?"
30,Prospect,"I tell you what, if you've got kind of a cut sheet or some documentation or handouts that you'd like to send over, I can take a look at them. uhm feel free to do that, allow me to review and kind of see what you'll offer and then I can make a decision from there if that works for you."
30,SDR,That works for me. What's the email?
30,Prospect,"Yes, W-arnold. w-a-r-n-o-l-d at quick serve, q-u-i-k-s-e-r-v dot com."
30,SDR,"Got it. And last question for you, when you think about your current process, you record all those Microsoft Teams calls um what's.. what's been the.. you know if you had a magic wand, then you could.. you could have something where you got a lot more value from those calls. What would that look like? The only reason I ask is that way I can send the right content for you."
30,Prospect,uh.. so what would be the right call? Is that what you're asking?
30,SDR,"So I'm saying, if you had a magic wand and you could.. you could change one thing about how you're using those Microsoft Teams call recordings, what would that one thing be; to make it easier for you, to make it more effective, what would you do?"
30,Prospect,"Uh just the i guess the compatibility of being able to condense that file and send it to people that uh.. you know.. i send a lot of this information and people need to be able to evaluate it and look at it and read it and so if that content could be collapsed versus trying to send a larger file, a larger recording. That would certainly be helpful."
30,SDR,"Interesting. Okay, so Wade, are you.. when you record at Microsoft Teams meeting are you then sharing that with your customer and your prospect, who can share it with other decision makers?"
30,Prospect,"uh.. in some sense, yes. I will send it to people who request it, I'll send it to some of our trainees also people across the country that need to review it and look at it uh but yeah for the most part it's nice that they're sending it to their customers, I just provide it for anyone that asks."
30,SDR,"Okay that is a yeah.. that's something.. that's sending a snippet. I can.. I'd be happy to share.. I'll even share a snippet of our call so you can see what that looks like? with the video of the teams. And hey last question for you umm.. across Quickserve, so outside of commercial sales, how many total uh customer facing reps are there? So if you look at the entire business outside of your segment."
30,Prospect,"uh.. we've got a few out there on the field right now, probably anywhere between half a dozen to upwards to, you know two dozen. It all just depends on who's hiring, some of our distribution partners out there, some of our agency reps, uh people of that nature. So yeah it ranges anywhere between half a dozen to maybe up to two dozen or so."
30,SDR,Okay. Okay and then do you guys have a call center as well?
30,Prospect,uh.. you're you're basically speaking to it. This is our call center here in Houston.
30,SDR,"Oh, interesting! Okay, so because I knew you're a commercial sales manager and when you started talking about Microsoft Teams, I was getting the impression that your team's dealing with some of the mid-size commercial accounts as opposed to being more of like, uh, you know, like a call center taking inbound calls and doing outbound calls like that."
30,Prospect,We do. We have our own team here internally that supports a lot of different customer bases out there.
30,SDR,"Got it. Okay, because you've got your partners and your distribution channel, so you're.. you're supporting them there as well."
30,Prospect,"Correct, yes."
30,SDR,"All right, very good. Hey, last question because I know you mentioned you use Teams and you're thinking about switching the CRM, but that hasn't happened anytime soon, umm.. do you have a call center management platform that you use, like Five9, RingCentral, that kind of thing?"
30,Prospect,"uh.. I honestly could not tell you what our internal system are.. uh I'm not that familiar with it or who runs, better operates that. So I couldn't even tell you that, honestly."
30,SDR,"Okay, and what I meant by that is, like, your team that's taking phone calls, when they take inbound phone calls. What is that phone system that they're using for taking the inbound calls?"
30,Prospect,"uh.. we just have Comcast, for that matter; I guess that's all I can really kind of reveal or tell you.. I.. uh, really don't know."
30,SDR,"No that's okay, no Comcast works just fine. Hey Wade, thanks for taking the time. I really appreciate it, and uh.. you know I'll drop you this info. Hey, last go, because I'll tell you what, that problem you have where you're trying to send recordings, big recordings, we can help you solve that one actually quite easily. Would you be open to.. because I know you're going to look at that info, you're probably going to have questions. Would you be open to a quick call after you see it? So, I'll send it over, and then we do a calendar, and again, we can keep it real brief. When you see this, I think you're going to go, wow, you know, that would help me a lot."
30,Prospect,uh.. allow me to review everything and then I can get back to you on it.
30,SDR,"Very good. Wade, thank you for your time."
30,Prospect,Yep. Absolutely.
31,SDR,"Hello, Tom. I'm gonna be honest with you this is actually a cold call. Would you like to hang up or let me have 30 seconds?"
31,Prospect,That depends on what it's about.
31,SDR,"Ah, Well, okay, so let me have 30 seconds and if you don't want to talk to me at the end, we can end it there. Sound fair?"
31,Prospect,"Yeah, fine, yeah."
31,SDR,"Alright, Tom, so I typically get invited in by managing directors of successful and ambitious companies, but they have the honesty to recognize perhaps sales is a bottleneck to growth and so they're probably frustrated that their salespeople maybe are not motivated or reluctant to pick up the phone. Others are worried that perhaps, that's not an issue, but when they do, if they listen to them, they sound a bit cringe-worthy, and they think to themselves, 'You know what, I probably wouldn't want to meet with that person.' Or that may not be the case, it could be the fact that you're a little concerned they don't qualify hard enough, and as a result you're running around kissing frogs, meeting the wrong sort of person, and it's having a knock-on effect. I mean, I get the feeling you're probably gonna tell me that none of that applies in your world."
31,Prospect,"No, I think you can always improve sales, that's for certain, it's the heartbeat of a business. So yeah.. sorry, I didn't catch your name."
31,SDR,"Oh, it's Benjamin, sorry my fault. So can I just ask a quick question? Of those three things, not picking up the phone, perhaps not engaging decision-makers, or perhaps not sounding like they belong, if you could wave a wand and fix one in your business, which would it be?"
31,Prospect,"I think it's about activity, actually. So it's about meeting more of the right people."
31,SDR,Talking to more of the right people?
31,Prospect,Yeah.
31,SDR,"Okay, I've had my 30 seconds, do you mind if we talk for maybe one more minute?"
31,Prospect,"Yeah, sure."
31,SDR,"So, when you say, 'the activity', what do you mean exactly? Can you give me an example?"
31,Prospect,"I just mean it's about lead generation, and you know, getting to the right people. So we've got a great offer, but it's about trying to get to those people. So, having more warm conversations. So that we can explore needs. A little bit like you're doing today. So, Benjamin, tell me about you, what do you do, what do you want?"
31,SDR,"Well, if I told you I help fix these problems, and I've helped companies in your sector eliminate some of these forever, I mean, what would you say? Would you say that's something you'd want to explore further?"
31,Prospect,"Yeah, I'd certainly be interested."
31,SDR,"Okay, so let me ask you a question. Let's pretend I could help your guys get through to more people at the right level, and you believed I could do that, is there any reason you wouldn't invite me in for half an hour, 45 minutes?"
31,Prospect,"No, no, absolutely not."
31,SDR,"No? Have you got your diary there, then?"
31,Prospect,"I do, yeah."
31,SDR,Great! What date are you looking at?
31,Prospect,uh.. not next week.
31,SDR,"No? Good, I'm camping next week."
31,Prospect,"Oh, lucky you."
31,SDR,"Yeah well, it's gonna rain, so maybe not so lucky, I'm thinking."
31,Prospect,"Let me look. uhm.. may be on Thursday, the 7th?"
31,SDR,"Oh, I'm with a training all day that day."
31,Prospect,Okay.
31,SDR,How's the eighth look for you?
31,Prospect,"uh, the eighth.. actually I'm in London on the eighth. So I could meet.. I don't know where you're based, whereabouts are you? Could you meet in London?"
31,SDR,"I could if need be, yeah, if you wanted to meet in London that's fine. Happy to do that. Where are you based?"
31,Prospect,I live in Sussex. My business is in London.
31,SDR,"Perfect! Yeah, I could meet you in London. What time would you like to meet, and whereabouts?"
31,Prospect,"So why don't we do ten o'clock? Somewhere in the West end, Picadilly area?"
31,SDR,"Yeah, sounds great! 10 a.m. on the 8th. Can I get an email from you, and I can confirm this with you as well?"
31,Prospect,"Yeah, its my first name at company dot com."
31,SDR,"Okay, now, can we just agree on a couple of things? Like I said, I don't know if I can help you, so if by the end of this meeting you don't feel comfortable with me, or you don't think I'm someone you want to move forward with, would you feel okay telling me no?"
31,Prospect,"Yeah, I would, absolutely. I don't waste people's time and I don't waste my time."
31,SDR,"No, great, man after my own heart. And likewise, look if I don't feel like I can help you, I'll be honest as well and say, 'you know Tom, I can't help you.' You wouldn't be upset if I said I couldn't help you despite the fact you're agreeing to meet with me?"
31,Prospect,"No, no, that's fine. And if you could send me some stuff beforehand that outlines the sort of stuff you do."
31,SDR,"Yeah, yeah I'm happy to do that. Anything specific you want to see?"
31,Prospect,Nothing specific. May be about lead generation and who you've worked with before.
31,SDR,"Alright. Oh, and one last thing, look if we don't say no to each other, do you mind spending a few minutes trying to figure out a clear next step on how we'd move forwards? If we get that far."
31,Prospect,"Of course, yeah."
31,SDR,"Fine! Well, look, I'll send you an email confirming this, and I'll get an invite over to you. And oh, one last question, can you think of any reason you might want to cancel? I mean you're not gonna hang up and think, 'Oh my goodness what have I just done? I've just agreed to meet a Salesman.'"
31,Prospect,No.
31,SDR,"I thought I'd ask. Hey, I appreciate your time. Have a great weekend, and I'll see you in a couple of weeks."
31,Prospect,"Okay, great stuff."
31,SDR,"Cheers, thank you!"
31,Prospect,Bye.
32,SDR,Hi am I reaching the owner of Cake's Body Bar?
32,Prospect,Yes.
32,SDR,"Great. So, I'm gonna be honest with you this is a cold call, uh.. so I do have something to pitch to your business. Would you like to hang up now or give me 30 seconds and then you can decide."
32,Prospect,No go ahead and tell. I'm driving but I can listen.
32,SDR,"Alright, thank you. Yeah, so I checked out your listing on Google, uh, and I saw that you do body sculpting. So we actually are an agency that helps uh estheticians and Medspas with their client acquisition, umm.. so hypothetically, if you'd work with us, we actually handle your entire advertising as well as the appointment setting process. So we have a team of uh appointment setters actually call the leads for you and uhm.. so we get you a minimum of 15 prepaid Body Sculpting appointments in your calendar every month or your money back. Does that sound like a fair deal?"
32,Prospect,"It does, but honestly, right now, I completely stopped advertising because, but I'm too busy. It's just me in the saloon, I'm a sole proprietor, I'm the only one, there's no employees it's just me and when I was doing even just minimal, like I had one um.. ten dollar, fifteen dollar a month budget for Google ad and another one that was about fifty dollars for Facebook. Umm.. but I haven't ran anything in about six months because I was getting too much business and I didn't.. I was having to put.. schedule appointments three or four weeks out and by that time people were uh.. looking for care elsewhere. They needed.. uh they wanted Services sooner than that."
32,SDR,"Oh, Okay."
32,Prospect,"But you can put me on a call back list, and this is a service I'm interested in uhm.. eventually having uh just right now I'm in the middle of uh.. I mean it's just me. I am trying.. in the middle of negotiations trying to get a building where I can hire some of my students that I've taught and have them come in and I can provide services to more than one person at a time but right now I can only.. I'm, I'm running one room out of a, uh,, I'm running a suite, basically. And it's just me, there's no room for me to service more than one client and right now business is great so this is a good thing, just uh.. I'm not able to.. that's not something I'm able to do right now. Would you be able to put me.. schedule me a callback then, cool?"
32,SDR,"Yeah, sure. Alright I'll probably call you back in like a month or so, is that okay."
32,Prospect,"Yes, that should be fine."
32,SDR,Alright. You have a good day.
32,Prospect,Thank you. You too.
33,SDR,"Hi, this is Ronan with Stylo.. you're actually not expecting this call. It's the first time I've tried to reach you. Mind if I share why I'm calling? You can let me know if it's relevant or not."
33,Prospect,Sure.
33,SDR,"Hey, appreciate that. Out of curiosity, you using a tool like zendesk or Salesforce for your ticketing today?"
33,Prospect,Salesforce.
33,SDR,"Okay, great. This next question, isn't a gotcha or anything, but do you have a way of knowing of all the tickets and cases, which one was the most urgent to get to this week?"
33,Prospect,"Yes, I do."
33,SDR,Very cool. A lot of people I speak with don't. Which is why I'm calling! How are you guys doing that?
33,Prospect,We've got our own in-house customer help score and triaging mechanism.
33,SDR,"Beautiful. That's kind of what Stylo does. I don't know if this would be of interest to you, but essentially we're using NLP to auto tag all your cases for you with relevant terms that reference back. And then we also assign sentiment like frustration and urgency, kind of all done for you in real time. Any interest in taking a look sometime?"
33,Prospect,"Possibly in the future. Right now, we're pretty happy with what we got and I don't have a lot of budget for any extra software at the moment."
33,SDR,"Yeah, totally understand that. Just one last question for you, when it comes to relaying what you're learning in Support back to Product, is that part of what you're able to do today with your current setup?"
33,Prospect,We do some of that with the data we collect from support cases and then collaborative workshops with the product team.
33,SDR,"Okay, cool. The reason I ask is that's also part of the value. Stylo is able to plug in and then also give you that reporting on the backend so that you can see those trends in real time as they unfold and communicate the more urgent stuff to work on, for Product and Engineering."
33,Prospect,That's interesting. You wanna send me some more information?
33,SDR,"Yeah, happy to do that. To be totally honest with you, I do this a lot and usually I send something, and that's kind of it. I've never heard back from someone. Would it be totally crazy to put 20 or 30 minutes on the calendar at some point when you have a few minutes to take a look?"
33,Prospect,"Usually, this time in the afternoon, Thursday or Friday next week."
33,SDR,"Alright, about Thursday, 2 PM?"
33,Prospect,That works.
33,SDR,"Awesome. So I'll send you a calendar invite shortly, along with some info and let's chat next week. You have a good one."
33,Prospect,You too. Bye.
34,SDR,"Will, you're going to hate me, if I told you it was a cold call, would part of you want to slam the phone down or perhaps have 30 seconds before you choose?"
34,Prospect,"Dude, this is like the fourth call I've had today, uhm.. but I'll give you a chance. What's this about?"
34,SDR,"So, typically, we get invited in by successful LinkedIn influencers who have a tendency to skip lunch. So some say that they're frustrated that they're looking at their fridge and thinking, 'I don't want leftovers again.' Others tell me things like, 'Do you know what, the store is far too long to drive to.' and as a result, they have bellies rumbling. But I get the feeling you're going to tell me, you don't recognize or experience that?"
34,Prospect,I skipped breakfast today. I know I'm going to be grumpy by the time my kids get home at five so it's actually quite funny that you reached out.
34,SDR,"Yeah, so I've had my 30 seconds. Do you mind if I ask you a couple of questions?"
34,Prospect,"Yeah, please go ahead mate. Yeah.. alright I'll stick it around. Thank you."
34,SDR,Is there any meal you had that you really fancy right now?
34,Prospect,"Yeah, I'd probably say just a really, really cheesy pizza. My favorite type of pizza - Costco. You ever tried the Costco pizzas?"
34,SDR,What specifically about the Costco pizza that you like?
34,Prospect,"They go heavy on the cheese. Cheap as well, it's only two ninety-nine a slice."
34,SDR,Wow! That's an absolute steal. Is there any particular reason you can't just drive to Costco now before picking up the kids?
34,Prospect,"If I drive to Costco right now, it will take me half an hour to get there and half an hour back. And frankly, I just can't afford to take an hour out of the day today, I'm too busy."
34,SDR,"Look, can I ask you a bit of a personal question?"
34,Prospect,"Yeah, for sure, go ahead."
34,SDR,"Let's pretend I was able to get, a cheesy double pizza ordered and delivered to your house before you have to pick up the kids. What would your wife think of that?"
34,Prospect,She'd be pleased that we didn't get takeout for dinner because she's not a very big fan of pizza. She's lactose intolerant.
34,SDR,"I hear that a lot. I hear that all the time. Look, let's pretend we could get that delivery to you in the next 20 minutes would you want to book that right now?"
34,Prospect,"Yeah, absolutely."
34,SDR,"Brilliant! Well, I'll book that order for you now, and if it's better than Costco, you have to refer me to all your friends. That sound fair, Will?"
34,Prospect,"If it's good, then yeah, of course."
35,SDR,"Hey Will, this is Alexa over at Pareto. Happy Thursday. I was wondering if you had about 30 seconds to chat?"
35,Prospect,"Sure, I've got a moment. What's this about?"
35,SDR,"Well, we worked with like, lots of CROs in your setting that are struggling to, uh.. you know, find new business, find and retain talent. You know, what would you say right now is your biggest sales challenge that you're currently facing?"
35,Prospect,I would say it's pipeline. It's just not coming through.
35,SDR,"Okay, so.. uh.. why do you think that, you know, your current SDRs are struggling to build that pipeline?"
35,Prospect,"One reason I feel is that they're not taking the feedback on board that I'm giving them. They're not bringing the right attributes to the table. I just think they're lacking the.. uh.. the will, to get better."
35,SDR,"Do you think that your current team needs training, or do you think, you'd rather hire?"
35,Prospect,I will probably fire two of them and hire two more.
35,SDR,"Since you're struggling with, you know, lead generation with your current SDRs and looking to hire more, I think it would be extremely beneficial to get some time in the calendar say Monday or Tuesday at 10:00 a.m. to further discuss."
35,Prospect,"I would say the one consideration I have, is cost, right? Like I am curious to know if Outsourcing is comparative in cost to bringing someone on full-time. Less? More?"
35,SDR,"Will, I'm not calling you to ask you to cut a check or anything. There's simply no talking about price, you know, I just want to sit down with you and really hear what your challenges are, so I can see if, you know, Pareto can support you in any way doing that. I know you said you had availability either Monday or Tuesday at 10:00 a.m. Which day would work best for you?"
35,Prospect,Tuesday would be better.
35,SDR,"You know, Will, I wouldn't hang up the phone without asking if you knew anyone else that you think would benefit from Pareto's services - Outsourcing and, you know, training your current talent. Does anyone come to mind?"
35,Prospect,"Yeah, I've actually got a friend who.. uhm.. who's in a similar pickle we talk about this quite a lot."
35,SDR,"Great, what's his name?"
35,Prospect,"Do you mind if I have a chat with him first just to make sure he's happy for me, like giving out his name and stuff. I would hate to upset him in anyway."
35,SDR,"You know, Tuesday at 10 a.m., I will ask you about that, I just want to let you know now."
35,Prospect,"Yeah, absolutely."
35,SDR,Brilliant! Really looking forward to it.
35,Prospect,"Yeah, I'm looking forward to it too. Speak soon."
36,SDR,"Hey Will, this is Abdullah. We don't know each other could I tell you why I called, in 30 seconds and you can decide if you want to speak longer?"
36,Prospect,"Yeah, alright, mate, but I'm a bit busy, so keep it quick."
36,SDR,"Okay, I will. Normally, what I hear from companies like Sell Better is that, they're always on the lookout for new sponsors, but if they're honest, they're probably struggling with one of two things. The first one is they feel like they're spending a lot of time, you know, creating content, hosting shows. They don't have enough time looking for new sponsors and as a result, they feel like they're losing revenue. If that's not an issue, other times they are making the time to reach out to more sponsors, but they feel like they're speaking to a lot of people that are either not qualified or they're simply not the decision maker. And as a result, their sales cycles tend to be longer, and sometimes, deals are false. Will, I get this feeling you're going to tell me you don't have any of these issues, I'm barking up the wrong tree, and you want to wish I went away."
36,Prospect,I would say the second one is definitely something I've noticed. I didn't hear where you're calling from. What do you offer to help with that?
36,SDR,"It's a really good question, Will. If I told you I wanted to come into Sell Better and be the person to prospect for these sponsors and get you in front of the right types of people, what would you say? Would you say that's something you'd want to explore?"
36,Prospect,"I'd be open to make an intro, but I certainly wouldn't be the person deciding for that role."
36,SDR,"No that's totally fine. I guess, could I use this as more of a research call? Would that be fair?"
36,Prospect,That would be fair.
36,SDR,"So you mentioned that the second issue stood out to you a little bit more. How exactly are you going about this right now? Like, how are you getting in front of these sponsors?"
36,Prospect,"Currently, we have a small team doing the majority of our outbound. And they're doing a great job of that and given that we're in a quite limited space, we know the accounts we should be trying to work with. The issue is that usually when we get into that conversation with sponsors, the expectations aren't aligned with what we can deliver."
36,SDR,"When you say expectations, like could you tell me a little bit more about that?"
36,Prospect,"Yeah, so sometimes people think those leads are going to be ready to buy, but they're not. Let's be real you don't attend a webinar and suddenly go, 'Okay, I'm ready to buy now'. That's just not how most people's mindset works."
36,SDR,"Right, I get that. So you have like, your team going after these sponsors right now. Have you ever tried to hire somebody outside to do this for you?"
36,Prospect,I'm not sure. The person who would be knowing and making decision on that type of thing on hiring people would be Chris in HR.
36,SDR,Okay. Do you believe it would be a bad idea for you to introduce me to Chris?
36,Prospect,"I wouldn't want to put him in an awkward position. I'll probably first have a conversation with him, see if there is interest in hiring someone."
36,SDR,Okay. No issues. So what would the next step be like?
36,Prospect,"I'll email him, see if he's got any interest of hiring anyone new. If there's not, I'll probably tell you and just say, 'Hey, despite the fact that you've got great chops, and I respect the cold call. It's just not something they're not looking to do right now.'"
36,SDR,"Okay, I really appreciate that, Will. I'm going I ask you one last question before I let you go."
36,Prospect,"Yeah, what is it?"
36,SDR,"If you were a young guy and you were looking to break into sales and you wanted to start off an SDR, how would you go about getting hired?"
36,Prospect,"Honestly, I'd do exactly what you're doing right now. What you're doing right now is showing me that you probably could do the job as an SDR, and if you can show it to a hiring manager, then they're going to be much more likely to take you seriously."
36,SDR,"I really appreciate that, Will. Thank you so much. And could I ask you one last question? I promise this is the last one."
36,Prospect,"Alright, you did say this was the last question last time, but I'll give you one more. Go ahead."
36,SDR,"Thanks, so like, if there was anything that you could improve about the call that I just had with you, what would it be? I'm always looking to get better."
36,Prospect,"I think it was good, mate. Better than a lot of people who call me these days."
36,SDR,"Thank you so much, man. This gives me a lot of confidence."
36,Prospect,"Man, get out there. You should have confidence, you're already outperforming most SDRs I listen to. Someone would be lucky to work with you."
37,SDR,"Hi, is this Mike?"
37,Prospect,"Yes, it is. Who's calling?"
37,SDR,"Hi, Mike, this is Josh from Motif. I'm calling because I noticed that your team has been growing, and I wanted to see if you'd be open to exploring a solution that could help streamline your sales process and improve your overall conversions. Do you have a couple of minutes?"
37,Prospect,Who are you with.. and what exactly is this about?
37,SDR,"I'm with Motif, we specialize in helping B2B companies like yours optimize their sales pipeline and provide actionable insights for your sales team. Does that sound like something you'd be interested in exploring?"
37,Prospect,"No, I don't think so. We already have a CRM, and we're pretty satisfied with how things are going."
37,SDR,"That's awesome to hear that you're happy with your CRM! We don't compete with your CRM, though. Instead, we work alongside it, enhancing your team's efficiency by scoring leads and helping your reps focus on the ones most likely to close. Do you find that your team sometimes spends too much time on low-potential leads?"
37,Prospect,"Sometimes, maybe. But we have good processes and a good team that gets decent results. I'm not going to fix something that isn't broken just because you tell me to."
37,SDR,"I completely understand. The last thing we want is to overwhelm your team with unnecessary tools. But just to clarify, even without changing your process, our solution integrates directly into your workflow and provides real-time insights that could increase your team's effectiveness. Would it be worth scheduling a quick demo to see how it could complement what you're already doing?"
37,Prospect,"I appreciate the offer, but we're not looking to make any changes any time soon so I'm going to pass."
37,SDR,"Totally understand, Mike. Would it be okay if I checked back in a few months to see if the timing is better or if things have changed?"
37,Prospect,"Sure, that's fine, but to be honest, I don't think it would be any different than now."
37,SDR,"No problem at all. I appreciate your time today, and I'll reach out later if things evolve. Have a great day!"
37,Prospect,Alright. Bye.
38,Prospect,Hello.
38,SDR,Prontik?
38,Prospect,Yes.
38,SDR,"Prontik, it's Ronan here with RecordReview. Look, you don't know me, actually. I'm a complete stranger cold calling you. Mind if I tell you why?"
38,Prospect,Sure.
38,SDR,"Cool, I appreciate it. uhm.. real quick, actually, before I dive in and do my whole dog and pony show. uhm.. as a CTO at your company, are you at all thinking about integrations and interoperability for all of the EHR data that you guys are dealing with?"
38,Prospect,We don't really have extensive HR needs right now. We have an outsourced HR provider.
38,SDR,"Oh, sorry, let me clarify. Not HR specifically. When it comes to, like, electronic health records and EHR data, that is health-related data."
38,Prospect,"Oh you meant, EHR."
38,SDR,"Yes, sir."
38,Prospect,"Yeah, we have some integrations with Salesforce. We're not into the EHR from a, like an HL 7 type, point of view yet. Is that what you're referring to?"
38,SDR,"Yeah, that's exactly it. And actually, that's the reason for my call. I'm curious, have you ever heard of RecordReview before?"
38,Prospect,No.
38,SDR,"Okay, well, I was hoping you'd make my job easier. So, in a nutshell, basically what we do is we're a one-stop shop for all of your EHR integrations. One API, one connection. Think of it as, like, a middle layer. And we've got over 90 plus integrations, pre-built, over 5000 networks that we tap into. Reason for my call was actually to share a little bit more, specifically for how, when you start to scale out and grow your team, you won't suddenly become overwhelmed with all the integration maintenance that your engineers might have to waste a ton of time on. And what ends up happening? I don't know if you're already seeing this, it is like when you build them out, you know, custom build in-house, the maintenance can be pretty, pretty time consuming. Not to mention what happens when you actually have new prospects who are like, 'Oh, we need an integration to this. Do you have it?' So essentially, we solve for all that by doing it for you. Look, would it be a terrible idea? I just pulled up in my calendar. Would it be a terrible idea if we found 30 minutes where, when I'm not cold calling you, we could explore how we might be able to help you grow out your integrations, at scale."
38,Prospect,Sure. I think in a couple of weeks would be good. So may be.. let me see here… uhm… Friday week after next.
39,Prospect,Hello?
39,SDR,"Hey James, I know I'm catching you out of the blue here. This actually is a cold call. Mind if I share why I'm calling you, and then you can decide if you want to hang up?"
39,Prospect,Sure.
39,SDR,"Awesome. I guess before I do my whole, like, dog and pony show here, I should probably ask you, are you already thinking about or have invested in any outbound strategy at your company, like any SDRs or external services?"
39,Prospect,"Yeah, we have one on staff. I mean, we're probably not a good fit for you just because uh, our sales cycle is very long. Our deal size is very big, and so it's less about volume and more about quality."
39,SDR,"Large deals is exactly what we specialize in. So my name is Ronan. I'm one of the co-founders at the Call Guys. Hey, out of curiosity, I know you just mentioned you already have one SDR on staff here. Is that person able to get you to, like, 4 to 5 X coverage of the pipeline that you're going for in a predictable manner?"
39,Prospect,Not quite.
39,SDR,No worries. That's actually why I was reaching out. Have you ever considered working with consultants who have built SDR teams for other companies? Who can help you have more predictability through proven processes and techniques? Anything like that ever cross your radar?
39,Prospect,"Yeah, we've tried a couple of things. I think the problem for us is that you really, like, in order to actually get a meeting in our space, you really have to be, like, you have to have deep expertise in what we do. And uh… you know an outsourced version of that just hasn't ever really worked for us. Because of that, you know, expertise, it's just so crucial to actually getting a meeting."
39,SDR,"Totally. Yeah. Actually, we're not outsourced. We would be in-house consultants. Essentially, what we do at the Call Guys, just to clarify, is we'd come in for six or nine months and just help you stand up an internal SDR team, and build it the way that I was able to build one at a unicorn tech company from almost nothing to now over 120 million ARR. So the same processes that we've learned over the course of our careers, we'd help you build out the same one for your stage of company."
39,Prospect,"That sounds good, but you know, like our situation is bit different than what you might have faced with other clients. So I'm not sure how you guys might be able to help with that."
39,SDR,"Fair point. Look, I know I'm catching you out of the blue here. Actually, the reason for my call was to find a better time. Would it be, like, totally insane if we did a quick eval with you sometime next week to see if we might even be able to help?"
39,Prospect,"Man, I mean, my schedule is terrible. I'm probably not even, like, the exact right person to be talking to. I mean, I'm the one that wants more deals through the pipeline for sure."
39,SDR,"But just to confirm, you are the CEO, right?"
39,Prospect,True.
39,SDR,"Okay. So I don't know how you couldn't be the right person. I'm going to call BS on that, James."
39,Prospect,"I mean, it's just like, you know, I have people on my team that bear responsibility for that pipeline."
39,SDR,"Well, that's actually great. We don't want to work with companies that don't already have people responsible for that. So that makes it even more of a fit. But look, I don't want to strong arm you into anything if you're not looking for ways to create that consistent, predictable pipeline. No stress at all. I totally get timing is everything here. But if you'd be open to hearing a few ideas, no strings attached, and just getting a chance to meet myself and my partner Kevin, how would maybe this time next week on Tuesday look for you?"
39,Prospect,"How about, uh.. I mean uh.., rather than put time on my calendar, which is precious, uhm, would love, just like, uh, if you can send me like, uh, an overview or even just like your website, and I can get a sense for what you're doing, Uhm, and then I would probably introduce you to my chief growth officer, uhm, who is thinking about this problem. uhm, I mean, I'm happy to come to a meeting once she, you know, sort of takes a look and that'd be a good use of time."
39,SDR,"Yeah.. Fair enough. I just sent you a connect request on LinkedIn. My LinkedIn, I feel like, really speaks for me more than anything else. So take a look at that. And your chief growth officer is the one who would ultimately be the one overseeing a program like this? If I'm understanding correctly?"
39,Prospect,It's true. Yep.
39,SDR,"Okay, great. Well, I'll tell you what. I just sent that connect request. And to be honest with you, I have done this a long time, as you can tell. And every time I send an email to someone, I have still never heard back from anyone. Shocker! So, you know, would it be really, like, too insane if we just found some time to pencil in after, of course, you get a chance to take a peek at maybe my LinkedIn profile and see if something like what I do might be a fit?"
39,Prospect,"Yeah, I'm probably not going to put them on the calendar right now, but yeah, let me chat with our growth officer about it and get back to you."
39,SDR,Alright. Appreciate that. I'll look forward to it. You have a good one.
39,Prospect,"Yeah, you too. Bye."
40,Prospect,Mark speaking.
40,SDR,"Hi Mark, we don't know each other. If I mention this is a cold call, will you throw your phone out the window?"
40,Prospect,"It's an interesting approach. I'm in the middle of a meeting, but you've clearly stated it's a solicited call, which is admirable. So I'm going to give you a little bit longer. What can I do for you this morning?"
40,SDR,"I typically work with Commercial leaders like yourselves that got couple of issues with the sales team. They lack confidence, like they would never crack a joke like that or they wouldn't deal with objections properly. Either way, that leads to poor conversion rates, therefore poor pipeline, and fundamentally hurts the bottom line."
40,Prospect,You would be correct. That is often the case. I'm intrigued. Tell me something about yourself.
40,SDR,"So usually I'm invited by commercial leaders to solve the problems that I mentioned. But before we get to work, I first have a deep discovery call, to kind of get a better sense of how things are at the moment, with your sales team and then see if I can even be of any help, you know, because at this point, I'm not sure if I can really help you or not. It could very well be that you might have a different kind of problem that doesn't fall under my expertise and in that case I'll tell you fair and square that 'Hey Mark, I'm not the right person to help you', but I will guide you to someone who can."
40,Prospect,"I liked your approach. Very different. Send me some details about yourself and we can have a chat, because you got further than anybody has this year. So well done. Do you have my contact email?"
41,SDR,We don't know each other. This is technically a cold call. Not sure if you want to throw the phone out of the window or let me explain why it could be relevant.
41,Prospect,"I'm not going to throw my phone out of the window, because that'd be too expensive, but go on, you got 30 seconds."
41,SDR,"Awesome. So, I'm usually invited by sales leaders to fix a couple of problems like, when they try to set up their first sales team, the reps don't usually generate enough opportunities. Or at times they do perform, but it's not very consistent and predictable, so as a sales leader you're always like, on your toes. I don't know if that's a problem you're facing as well, or you've got more opportunities than you can handle, basically?"
41,Prospect,"uhm.. it's not necessarily that, but we don't work in that way. It's a totally different model."
41,SDR,"Right, right. Understand. Do you mind if I ask one last question then? In terms of client acquisition and business development, if there was one area that you'd like to improve, what might that be?"
41,Prospect,"So the thing is, we use an outsourced agency at the moment and they handle client acquisition for us. And we're about to hire another SDR with them."
41,SDR,"Okay. Okay, understood. And in terms of hiring SDRs, then, like, you already got a plan figured out of how that's gonna work?"
41,Prospect,"Yes. Yeah, we have. We've had a sales team earlier and it didn't work. So we're pretty clear what we need."
41,SDR,"Look, I guess then exchanging a few ideas about how this might be set up, with someone that's done it before. Would that not be in the cards at this time?"
41,Prospect,"Maybe, but yeah, I mean, that would be the only thing at the moment because, like I said, we're paying for an external agency already and then we're about to hire another SDR with them. So I'm not sure how you could be useful."
42,SDR,Hey Eric. This is Trent from D&D Wholesale Supply. How are you?
42,Prospect,Good.
42,SDR,"That's great to hear. The reason I was giving you a call specifically is I noticed that you oversee procurement at Zenphi, and I was curious, if the purchasing of the pharmacy supplies, like the pill vials, if that item falls in your wheelhouse."
42,Prospect,uh… Yes.
42,SDR,"Oh, Okay. Fantastic. I figured it did, and the reason why I wanted to reach out and introduce myself is, we are a manufacturer and distributor specifically for pharmaceutical containers, so pill vials, bottles, other items like that, and we specialize in working with leading vet clinics and hospitals like, Maverick for example, to help them standardize the purchasing of this item, because more often times, not each of their locations purchases independently. Has your team talked at all about standardizing an item like that, or have you looked at cost for that item in the recent months or years?"
42,Prospect,"uhm, I mean it really falls under I guess, what we consider as the ‘supplies' category, which all kind of falls under, I mean, we have a agreement with Patterson right now. So, all ordering of that stuff goes through them. And you know, as far as a percentage, of what we purchase, it's a probably on the lower end. But and the other thing, is all of our purchasing does go through Vetcove. So I don't know if you work through Vetcove or not, but we only purchase through Vetcove."
42,SDR,"Yeah I appreciate you sharing that. Vetcove is super convenient for customers because you can load up all the suppliers on there, Patterson, Covetrus, MWI, like everyone on there and I'm sure with Patterson, you probably have a rebate or some sort of purchasing requirement that gives you an advantage. Just for context, this is a niche item, and it may not be worth your time, honestly, but we find this item in particular; the vials can oftentimes represent massive savings. So, for example, if you look at any of the vendors on Vetcove, they are purchasing this item, vials directly from a manufacturer like us. So, they're inevitably going to have to upcharge it, an additional 30 -50%, 100% markup so they can achieve their margin. So all that's to say is in the event you were interested in getting cost savings, just by looking at the price comparison, I guarantee there'd be a significant savings, on just the vials alone, if you were to compare our cost to what you're paying today. Based on that context, would you be interested in in looking at maybe just a basic formulary for this one or two items, just so you can see for yourself?"
42,Prospect,Yeah feel free to email me that. I'll take a look.
42,SDR,"Alright. Well, I'm happy to send you the cost just transparently, without trying to get volume or your pricing today, just because I know for a fact there'd be savings. But what I find in some cases is, I could send it over and you may be thinking it may or may not be worth your time to look at it. Is this, the pharmacy supply, the vials in particular, I know you're getting it from Patterson and Vetcove, but would this be worth taking a look at, based on what you've heard today?"
42,Prospect,"uh.. I mean, I honestly, I just I always take a look any time somebody calls and then I'll probably go and when I get a second I'll go and look at it, and compare it to what we're purchasing now. But there's other reasons we order through Vetcove. We have a API link, so all the invoices come through and are sent through the API link to our accounting system, so we typically don't use companies that are outside of that because it changes how we purchase. It would be an exception to how we order in our clinics, and so that's difficult to do when we have 36, and soon to be a lot more clinics; we have to be as consistent as possible. So, I would look at that information and make the contact, uhm.. but yeah, I don't know that it would be something on our radar right now. But yeah, like I said, you feel free to email it to me, and I always keep that stuff in a file so that I can at least reference it later."
42,SDR,"Yeah, I really appreciate it. And that's exciting to hear about your growth. I'm curious if you have an agreement with Patterson? But all of your clinics use Vetcove, are they just like, it's up to their discretion to purchase through Vetcove that item based on whatever is the lowest at the time, from whatever Vendor?"
42,Prospect,"Yeah well, typically Patterson is where we get the most benefit from, but yeah, they have the discretion to order it from whoever they want to, on Vetcove. But if they don't order on Vetcove, then they would get an invoice, and then they have to allocate it, and send it over and it has to go through our accounting, like the uh.. accounts payable email address and it just adds layers of work. Whereas when it goes through Vetcove, it's included in our current processes. So that's why we only have just very few.. like uhm.. from a product supply standpoint, there's very little that we order outside of Vetcove."
42,SDR,"Sure. It sounds like it may not be a good fit. But let me just leave you with this antidote, so I'm working with a group in Ohio. They have about 105 vet clinics today, and they pulled together an aggregate report of their spending on just the pill vials alone, and it represented about six hundred thousand in total spend and 6 to 12 different suppliers. Many of their locations are using Vetcove, and the issue with this is – one, across all their different clinics, it's inconsistent products; so for example, your logo definitely isn't on the cap, and then secondly, when you actually aggregate together the total cost, even if they are all getting from Patterson across different locations, some are paying above market rate, some are paying below, but that's why getting together in an enterprise purchasing agreement, just for this item, it may not be worth the time if it affects the process, but there would be pretty meaningful savings upwards of, if I had to estimate back of the napkin math, between 25,000 and 40,000 based on your size. That's something I could guarantee. It's just a matter if we could figure it out process-wise or not, so what I'd like to do is, I'll put together just a very simple formulary of our cost, just so you can go in and see for yourself, is this probably isn't something that's been reviewed in quite some time because it's in the bottom two-third spend. But it's all we do, and we supply to groups like Patterson and they're buying it from a manufacturer, and they have to then charge way more to put it on Vetcove, even though it seemingly is the best market rate. So that would be the advantage of working directly with someone like us."
42,Prospect,"Okay. Yeah, sounds good."
42,SDR,"Alright Eric, well I really appreciate your time, and it seems like you would probably be hesitant to consider it further because your system is set up in a way that may not allow for the flexibility with the groups to order directly from us, but if the pricing is compelling enough, you can let me know and we can go from there."
42,Prospect,"Okay, sounds good."
42,SDR,"Thank you, Eric. Bye."
42,Prospect,"Yeah, thank you."
43,Prospect,This is Melissa.
43,SDR,Hey Melissa! This is Trent from D and D wholesale supply. How are you?
43,Prospect,I'm good.
43,SDR,"That's great to hear. The reason I was giving you a call, Melissa is I noticed that you were a director over at your company, and I was curious if you oversee the purchasing of the prescription containers, so the vials, the bottles, other items like that?"
43,Prospect,"Um.. so I'm actually on the long-term care side, so you'll want someone in the retail side.. um for that stuff, um.. and I would call the corporate office. Ryan and Chelsea are the directors over.. the retail side."
43,SDR,"Ryan and Chelsea. I appreciate it. Yeah.. I'll definitely call the corporate office and ask to speak with Ryan and Chelsea. Um.. we work with Pharmerica today and.. and they're also long-term care and they have a pharmacy within their Long-Term Care Division; is that.. is your Pharmacy within the retail side, it sounds like?"
43,Prospect,"Um.. Well our pharmacies.. um.. I mean, we have five or three long-term care pharmacies and then like.. 30 retail pharmacies in our company, so we have both."
43,SDR,"Okay, well, we're a manufacturer and distributor of prescription containers, so we've been doing it the last 18 years; all we do is the vials, bottles, and some other niche container plastics like that. We do the vials for PharMerica today, um.. we used to do it for Omnicare before they became part of CVS. So we believe, we can offer customers incredibly competitive pricing, uh while also high quality, like we could put your logo on the caps, for example, among other value add solutions. Would you be overseeing that for the long-term care pharmacies, the purchasing, because I.. I'd love to get you some pricing just so you can compare it to what you're paying today to see if there might be savings."
43,Prospect,"Yeah, and I'm going to be really honest. My last day is the 19th and that would have been me.. um.. so I think probably best is you call the corporate office and ask for Ryan or Chelsea and then they can kind of direct where that needs to go."
43,SDR,"Sure, well congratulations on the last day of the 19th.. uh.. that's exciting. Hopefully you can enjoy some time this summer and wishing you all the best in the next chapter."
43,Prospect,"Yeah, thank you. I appreciate that."
44,Prospect,"Hello, this is Tom."
44,SDR,Hey Tom. This is Michael with Vouris. How you doing today?
44,Prospect,"I’m doing well. Michael, with who?"
44,SDR,"With Vouris. I know I'm calling you out of the blue here, do you have 30 seconds for me to explain why I’m calling you?"
44,Prospect,About 30 seconds. I'm just in the middle of lunch and need to get some things done.
44,SDR,"Sounds good. So we actually talked about two months ago, but at a high level, we help early-stage companies build, scale, and optimize their outbound sales efforts. We typically work with companies that are either starting to build an inside sales team or their current team isn't producing the results they're looking for. When we first talked, you said this wouldn't be relevant now, maybe sometime in the future. Just curious, where you stand if either of these are resonating with you a little more now."
44,Prospect,"Yeah, no, we're in good shape right now. Um.. we've got a lot of things on the table, so I.. I don't think it's appropriate at this point."
44,SDR,Sounds good. Do you think it'll become more relevant in the future? Uh.. your plans with an inside sales team? You mind divulging a little there?
44,Prospect,"Yeah, I mean.. likely, we'll add some people, on our team, but we're probably not gonna outsource the hiring of that, or doing of that."
44,SDR,"Okay, So we do have a model which is - it's our sales team growth model. So if you have a revenue target that you want to see your sales org hit, and then like, we can use like either your current amount of reps or, if you want to hire reps, we can figure out, how many reps you need need to hire, what their activities should be to hit that target. Is that something that would interest you?"
44,Prospect,"No. I’m.. I’m pretty good at math. So um.. so yeah, I mean, you know that.. that part of it's pretty.. pretty straightforward. But you know, I think you sent me, if I'm not mistaken, you may have sent me an email with some info."
44,SDR,You’re spot on.
44,Prospect,"Yeah. So, um.. down the road, you know, always as I think I probably told you, always feel free to call me. I usually answer my phone. Um.. email's probably better in this case, just so I can take a look. I'm pretty good about responding without deleting. Just remind me that we've talked and I’ll be more generous with not deleting it. Um.. but yeah, feel free to check-in in six months, eight months and see where we are."
44,SDR,"Yeah, sounds good. You'll be.. you'll be on my own little private newsletter here."
44,Prospect,Haha… there you go.
45,Prospect,"Hello, this is James with Tovuti LMS. How may I help you?"
45,SDR,"Hey, James, it's Jacob from ServiceBell. How's it going, man?"
45,Prospect,Good. How are you doing?
45,SDR,"Pretty good. I'm cold calling you, but I figured you'd be open to it because you're an SDR manager and you're from Idaho, which I thought, you know.. people over there are kind of nice and friendly.. so figured, I'd give you a ring."
45,Prospect,"How can I help you, man?"
45,SDR,"Yeah, the reason I'm calling you is I sell a tool that lets you know when a customer is, let's say, on your pricing page or wants to talk to you, and then you can jump into a live video qualification call with them on the website, at the perfect time, instead of having to follow up over email or call or whatever. It's kind of like your HubSpot chat, but with video. Just curious how you guys handle inbound right now, or if you're more focused on outbound?"
45,Prospect,"Uh.. I mean, yeah, we, we do a ton of inbound. I.. I would say about 90% inbound. We are moving towards outbound. Uh.. that is kind of part of the plan for 2023, but.. uh.. yeah, If I were to put a percentage, I would say about 90% inbound."
45,SDR,"Wow. Well, that's great. And so I guess your team is fielding these leads, right?"
45,Prospect,"Uh.. I'm sorry, what was that?"
45,SDR,Your team is fielding the inbound leads.
45,Prospect,"Correct, yeah."
45,SDR,"That's great. So you guys have, I mean, are you using HubSpot? I see a HubSpot chat. Do you just have like a form that you guys follow up on as well when they come in?"
45,Prospect,"Uh huh.. Yeah.. So we utilize HubSpot and when, I mean, yeah, there's uh.. we have the chatbot and when they complete a form, then.. it'll go to one of our SDRs. Uh.. It'll round robin to one of the SDRs nicely. We recently.. we implemented ZoomInfo, so now we can see who submitted a form, when they submitted it, if they ever abandon a form fill, as well as any website visits."
45,SDR,"Wow, nice. That's awesome. And do you get additional company information as well?"
45,Prospect,We're getting that kind of data now. But can you uh.. send me over any documentation that you have? Because that product does sound uh.. intriguing.
45,SDR,"Well, I can do you one better. If you have an extra 30 seconds right now and you go to servicebell.com, I can call you and show you in, real-time and it will save you the time of the email and everything. And me."
45,Prospect,Okay. So going to service bell. That’s B-E-L-L dot com. Yeah?
46,Prospect,This is Colin. How can I help you?
46,SDR,"Colin, hey, it's Jesse. I'm calling from Podium. We haven't spoken before but David sent me your way. Came across your guys name through some work I'm doing in the area. I was just wondering if you had a minute."
46,Prospect,Um.. You said you're from Podium?
46,SDR,Yeah. Sounds like you may or may not have heard of us before.
46,Prospect,"You guys are a software company, right? You do lead conversions?"
46,SDR,"Yeah. Yeah, I guess to sum it up in a word, mostly foot traffic to stores. Most of our customers do that either through reviews, web chat, or lead conversion. One of the three. I was mostly curious to see, I mean, it sounds to me, you guys, just from the tone of your voice, you probably already have something in place for that."
46,Prospect,"We do. And I think somebody from Podium called me last week to discuss this as well. And I believe, I gave him my email address and asked him to send me some info just in case anything came around. But uh.. yeah, we’re pretty covered on that, at the moment. But I can give you my email again."
46,SDR,"Well, Colin, I appreciate you telling me. I'm sorry if we're giving off a bad impression by calling you again. I did not know that. But um.. I'd be more than happy to grab your email real quick. What's a good email I can reach you at?"
46,Prospect,It’s my first name at company name dot com.
46,SDR,"Awesome. Well, Colin, the last thing I want to do is be disrespectful. It sounds like you already spoke with us. You made your point clear. Um.. personally, the reason I wanted the call, I wanted to learn more about what you were doing. Is it appropriate for me to ask what you guys have been using right now, uh.. for Google reviews, for instance? Is that more of an in-house thing, or do you use more of a third party?"
46,Prospect,"For our Google reviews, um.. we.. truthfully, uh.. we don't do a lot with it. Um.. it was more of a conscious decision than anything else to do that, though. Um.. I believe before I started here, they hadn't been doing much.. with those Google reviews.. uh.. outside of, uh.. you know, recommending that folks send over those Google reviews, because we have a, you know, pretty stellar rating on there. Um.. but when it comes to.. uh.. you know, actually responding to those reviews. It's not uh.. it’s not something they did before I showed up here. And I was advised not to do anything with it."
46,SDR,"Okay, it sounds like, it's probably not the main way you guys are driving foot traffic to your store."
46,Prospect,It is not.
46,SDR,"Okay, well, let me.. Let me just ask you this before I get off the phone, Colin. Um.. it sounds like you clearly value the star rating you have. Uh.. not sure if you're very familiar, with the way Podium works, but I wanted to ask, um.. what's your opinion on having a system that automatically logs people into the Google accounts to make that process faster? A lot of my dealers have found issues using other software just because it's kind of a hassle getting people to actually fill out those reviews."
46,Prospect,"Uh.. I'll be honest with you, I haven't heard of many issues when it came to, uh.. our customers getting a way to submit those Google reviews. At this point, it's been pretty straightforward. Um.. most people who don't leave us with Google reviews are uh.. typically just older folks who, you know, are not thrilled with technology in general."
46,SDR,"Okay. All right, Colin. Well, I'll try to earn your respect here with one last try. Uh.. you know, it sounds like the first thing that came to mind, when you heard of us was lead conversion. Um.. what's your opinion on having an AI step in when your BDC people, maybe don't have the bandwidth to reach those online leads, or maybe for like after-hours leads, for instance. Do you see that being valuable, to carve out 15 minutes, maybe just to put it in front of you? Kind of a low-pressure demo, just to kind of educate you a little bit more on it?"
46,Prospect,"To be honest with you, at this time, uh.. probably not. Um.. the reason for that is because the sales staff that we have at the moment, they're, they all have over ten or 15 years of experience, so they all have a pretty steady system that they use to find success, when it comes to, uh.. follow up on the leads. Um.. current in-house process, for like after-hour leads, for example, you know, we let them know we're currently closed, but that somebody will reach out when, uh.. when we return to the office next morning. On days that we're off, including like Sundays, um.. we have someone who is dedicated to, uh.. answering those Sunday leads specifically. So, um.. And then we cover those tracks on the, uh.. following workday."
46,SDR,"Okay. All right, Colin, I'll let you go here. One last question. Um.. again, this is just mostly from my experience. I noticed that a lot of dealers where they see the value with Podium comes through the, um.. kind of the, uh.. quality of the leads. They've noticed that a lot of third-party leads, a lot of web chat leads. At first glance, it's hard to tell exactly what kind of quality they are. And so they're wasting a lot of time with people who don't leave contact info, um.. you know, aren't.. aren't willing to come in for uh.. a demo, whereas these salespeople could probably be spending their time elsewhere. Um.. is that an issue you're running into at all, or is that not the case?"
46,Prospect,"Uh.. Truthfully, that is not the case. We've been, uh.. we've been pretty good when it comes to, uh.. weeding out the quality leads from the, uh.. non-quality lead. Um.. you know, we've got all of our team that works together on, uh.. handling those. Uh.. those inquiries, and uh.. it's been a really good system to this point. Yeah. Truthfully, I don't, uh.. I don't have much of a, uh.. concern with that in, uh.. in our current process."
46,SDR,"Okay, well, good. You know, keep us in your back pocket, then. I'll shoot you an email. Again, I appreciate your time and, um.. yeah, maybe, maybe down the road something could work out."
46,Prospect,"Absolutely. I, uh.. I appreciate the call."
47,SDR,"Hey, is this Dustin?"
47,Prospect,It is.
47,SDR,"Hey, Dustin, this is Abe. Are you the person who deals with the travel at your firm, or is that someone else, like, booking hotels, that type of stuff?"
47,Prospect,"We’re really.. we're a small company, and so we just, kind of all take care of it on our own and submit expenses, reports and that's about it."
47,SDR,Gotcha. Sounds like you guys kind of take care of it on your own. It's pretty much covered.
47,Prospect,"We do. Yes, sir."
47,SDR,"Gotcha. Would you mind me asking, like, you know, how many people are actually traveling or maybe like an annual spend, like just a ballpark number?"
47,Prospect,"I mean, we don't have any that travel on a regular basis. Like, we just hit up, like, conferences and, you know, random meetings here and there, but.. but not a whole bunch. You know, if I had to guess, I don't know, a couple hundred thousand dollars, something like that."
47,SDR,"Gotcha. I mean, listen, I'll tell you what, the reason why I ask is because that definitely is a pretty good, like, a sweet spot for us. And we've been doing corporate travel for almost a decade now, and we've kind of been coming across the same issues, especially with businesses of your size, where they spend like a couple hundred thousand dollars, you know, and they don't really, like, nobody knows how much they're spending, you know, they don't actually have anyone in the office specifically dealing with it, who actually knows how to optimize travel. So, like, I know you said you guys are kind of doing it on your own, but do you actually have, like, a dedicated person at the office who would, like, handle those bookings for you guys?"
47,Prospect,"No.. no, you know, we've got a few assistants across the organization that help us occasionally, or, or we just book it on our own, one or the other. You know, I've worked in organizations where we've had a travel person to help us out and more.. more strict guidelines on, you know, use this book here, etcetera, and that's just not what we do here."
47,SDR,"Gotcha. That definitely makes sense. And I know that, you know, businesses that don't have someone specifically with travel experience, like you guys, where it's kind of like assistance, you know, they usually do end up obviously overspending on travel. And without even realizing, just because you're not really strategizing, you're not comparing prices, it's kind of just like, book the first flight, book the first hotel. So, I mean, I know our clients that have, just by switching over to us as a travel agent, they've saved almost 60% on travel. You know, just by comparing options, kind of having someone there to strategize. Um.. and that's really where we come in. We're like your CTO, kind of like a Chief Travel Officer. I know it sounds a little cheesy, but really, every one of our clients has, like, a dedicated account manager. You know, who kind of know how to fully optimize travel, has experience with this stuff. We have 24/7 support. I guess I'll ask you like this, and you tell me if this makes sense. Would you be opposed to kind of putting 15-20 minutes on the calendar, just so I could, you know, show you how it works? You could kind of decide then, if it's still not something you'd be open to."
47,Prospect,"Um.. I will be honest. I'm working towards a board meeting next week, and I have zero time for something like this. What I can do, is I, uh.. I'll ask my. I'll ask my assistant, who's been here much longer than I have, if they've ever considered something like it. And uh.. if they're open to it, then I can have them call you."
47,SDR,"Yeah, that would be great, I guess. Yeah, for sure. I know that when I kind of let you go, I'm probably never going to hear back from you again. Just being straight over here. I mean, like, I don't.. I don't want to, like, pressure, but if you have, like, 10-15 minutes, even if we could just put something on the calendar this way, we could even have your assistant join that call and take a look at it and see. I could send you this stuff to your email. You know, if you talk to her, and then she's like, no, we've done this before. No interest in speaking about it. You could cancel the meeting, but just to kind of, like, get something there so we have it, you know, if you're open to it."
47,Prospect,"No, I'll be honest. I'll save your time and my time both. It's kind of a dead end over here. We’re kind of a old school operation."
47,SDR,"All right. I got you. All right. Thank you so much, Dustin. I really appreciate you taking the time and listening."
47,Prospect,"Yeah, sure."
48,Prospect,Hello?
48,SDR,"Hi, is this Paul?"
48,Prospect,Who's calling?
48,SDR,"Hey, it's Abe. I just got off the phone with Asher. He told me to give you a call."
48,Prospect,Okay.
48,SDR,"You handle like, the patent side of things at the firm?"
48,Prospect,Right.
48,SDR,"Got it. So I wasn't 100% sure, but you deal also with like, the international side of things. Meaning like after the PCT stage?"
48,Prospect,"Yeah, I mean, anything we.. In fact, most of my clients are foreign clients."
48,SDR,"Got it. So, I mean, not to like, mislead you or anything, but this is like a cold call, but I’m calling you for a reason."
48,Prospect,"Yeah, okay. I always answer kind of abruptly because I get so many spam calls."
48,SDR,"Oh, yes, of course. Trust me, I know. Believe me. Basically the reason for the call is because I'm from Fairview IP Advisory. So we've actually been supporting IP firms for a very long time. And every lawyer that we talk to, paralegal, they kind of hate dealing with that side of things. The foreign filing, making sure the translations are good, trying to deal with the different time zones, deadlines, that kind of stuff. So obviously, that gives them less time to do the things that actually makes them money. So that's kind of where we come in. So we've been working with IP firms for almost 30 years to kind of take care of literally everything, foreign filing. I was just curious, like, so do you guys.. it sounds like you're doing that all on your own."
48,Prospect,"Yeah, I mean, we have some outside help that we utilize, but yeah, most of it's on our own."
48,SDR,"Sure. So you guys like, have relationships with, with foreign attorneys in all the countries, or at least, I guess, all the countries that you generally work with?"
48,Prospect,"Yeah, I would say there's not many that we don't have a relationship with."
48,SDR,"Sure, sure. And I guess the only other question I would ask, so in terms of, like, translations and, you know, making sure that the translations are certified, that you're not getting overcharged for your clients, do you guys have anything in place to make sure, you know, that’s all going smooth?"
48,Prospect,"Um.. Yeah, I mean, we've never really had a problem. All incoming stuff is already translated for the most part."
48,SDR,Sure.
48,Prospect,"So outgoing, uh.. I mean, it's not a huge quantity of it, so it's typically not an issue."
48,SDR,"Got it. Got it. So I guess my only other question before I let you go, would you be open to kind of hearing, you know, an alternate way to see, you know, if you could save time, save some money for your clients, would that be something you'd be open to?"
48,Prospect,"Um.. Probably not. I mean, I'm not sure. I mean.. like I said, we don't have a ton of incoming all the time and outgoing. It's not a whole heck of a lot of it.. I mean, there is stuff, but we never really have had a problem in the past."
48,SDR,"Sure. Um.. Okay. I mean, so, I guess, Would it be valuable for you to have, you know, kind of like a one push button type of thing for when those do come up, and then you could or at least, you know, hear about it, see if it's something that could help you?"
48,Prospect,"Yeah, I mean, we don't mind listening, that's for sure."
48,SDR,"Okay. So I guess, you know, obviously I don't want to kind of, you know, take up too much of your time, especially if it's not something that you're super, you know, you don't know tons about. Do you have, like, maybe ten minutes sometime? I'm trying to say, let's say tomorrow or Wednesday that I could get on the phone and just have someone actually explain it to you a little bit better."
48,Prospect,"Yeah, I mean, Wednesday is not good. Friday I'm working from home, so.. uh.. should be okay Friday."
49,SDR,Hey Daniel?
49,Prospect,Yes.
49,SDR,"Hey Daniel. You do patents, right?"
49,Prospect,I do. Who am I talking to?
49,SDR,This is Abe with Fairview IP. Do you guys deal with the international side of things also? Or you just stay in the US?
49,Prospect,"No, we can handle international as well."
49,SDR,"Got it. The reason I ask is um.. because, as I said, I'm from Fairview IP, so we've actually been supporting IP firms for over 30 years. And I'm sure you know this better than I do. I mean, every IP lawyer literally hates dealing with kind of the foreign filing side of things. You know, making sure the translations are good quality, trying to deal with the different time zones, get in touch with ten different attorneys in ten different regions. So that's kind of where we come in. We take care of literally everything foreign filing. Plus, we're ISO certified in translation, so you don't have to, you know, kind of sacrifice on that either. I guess, that being said, the real reason for the call, I just wanted to ask if you were maybe available to get on a quick call with someone, you know, that actually knows what they're talking about in terms of IP. You know, someone that would know a little bit more than I would. Um.. I guess. Would you be available to talk sometime next week? I know Monday's President’s Day, but I guess maybe either Tuesday or Wednesday. Would that work for you?"
49,Prospect,"I guess it kind of depends what I'm.. what I'm talking about. I mean, we have.. um.. where most of our foreign filings go, we have pretty good relationships with firms already, that handle the foreign filings, where.. where our clients want to go."
49,SDR,Sure.
49,Prospect,"So I.. uh.. and I'll be honest with you, I can't imagine that something that you guys would say is going to make me shift to an organization that's not a law firm. That is, I guess, going to shop it or going to do something. I mean, because we, truthfully, I mean, we, with the clients where we go, and being in Florida, and where I know our clients, want foreign filings. We have good relationships with firms already, that we're pretty happy with. I mean, so I don't know that it would be a worthwhile phone call for anybody."
49,SDR,"Sure. I definitely hear that. I guess the only thing I would ask, it sounds like you kind of have everything covered, um.. in terms of the foreign filing side of things. I guess.. I guess in terms of like, the translation quality, do you guys have any approach where, you know, you kind of know that the translations themselves are really top notch and that, uh.. you're not overcharging your clients."
49,Prospect,"No, the.. uh.. the translation would be a.. would be a different side of it."
49,SDR,Got it. Yeah.
49,Prospect,"So, if you guys.. um.. If we want to focus on a translation service, then.. then that might be worth a phone call."
49,SDR,"Sure. Okay. So. So, yeah, I mean, listen, we definitely do handle the filings and everything, but the translations are really what makes us stand above the other service providers, really, where we.. We use AI to kind of, you know, speed up the process, make sure that everything is quality through actual efforts. Human. So if you do the process, we keep the quality in place. So I guess if that's something that you'd be open to talking about, maybe next Tuesday. I can definitely have someone. You know, it would take, like, 10-15 minutes."
49,Prospect,All right. Tuesday works.
49,Prospect,Hello?
49,SDR,"Hi, is this Jacob?"
49,Prospect,"Yes, it is."
49,SDR,"Great. You are the owner, correct?"
49,Prospect,Yes.
49,SDR,"Okay. My name is Kirsten I'm calling with ClockShark. Um.. so we provide timekeeping automation software for construction. It helps, uh.. maximize field productivity and increase the time your remote employees spend at the job site by 10 to 15%. Um.. do you guys currently have a way to reduce nonproductive time and get accurate visibility into where those remote labor hours are being spent?"
49,Prospect,"Uh.. I believe we do. I don't get into the.. the operation side too much anymore, but I would believe they do okay."
49,SDR,Okay. Um.. would like an operations manager maybe be better to speak with?
49,Prospect,"Yeah so, um.. give me.. give me one more.. uh.. what.. what is exactly that your software does?"
49,SDR,"Um.. so we eliminate the need for field employees to manually indicate when they arrive at the job site and select the proper job code. So we use a GPS to track crew locations, and that GPS automatically allocates the daily hours to the proper job and activity codes. So I know a lot of companies, they have GPS's on the trucks, um.. you know, just to track crew locations, but then they're using usually T-Sheets or QuickBooks Time. Um.. and a lot of companies aren't aware that they can have this all-in-one. And it does integrate into most leading payroll systems, so that you guys can, um.. run payroll quickly as well."
49,Prospect,"Alright. So one of the problems I would see with that is.. so we.. uh.. our guys, actually, they meet at a meet and spot, different spots. And, uh.. then they.. they drive to the sites together as a group, and then they go back to that meet spot. So they.. they change all the time. How would that work in this system?"
49,SDR,"Um.. so you said they get out of one truck and all go into another truck? They'll meet at, like, a location?"
49,Prospect,"Yeah. They're meeting at different locations in the morning. Right. So, like, they're going to Rhode Island. We’ll say, we’re going to Rhode Island. We’re in mass. They're going to meet at a different location. If they go on the South shore, they kind of change their meeting spot every morning to, uh.. to minimize their drive time, we'll call it."
49,SDR,Right. And are they meeting in work trucks or their personal trucks?
49,Prospect,"So they drive their personal trucks to the meeting spot, and then from that point, then they drive to the site, together."
49,SDR,"Okay. Right. So, um.. I'm sure that would be more of, um.. our co-founder. His name is Rob. Um.. that would be more of his expertise and questions. I don't want to give you any false information. Would you mind if, um.. he gave you a team’s call, um.. just to discuss this more and answer any of those additional questions?"
49,Prospect,"I’m about to jump on a call in about three minutes here. So not now, but definitely we could we could set something up."
49,SDR,"Yeah, absolutely. I was, um.. hoping maybe, uh.. maybe early next week?"
49,Prospect,Sure
49,SDR,"Okay. Now, how many crews and people do you guys usually have in the field?"
49,Prospect,"Oh.. I don't know, 30 to 50.."
49,SDR,"Okay. And, uh.. does morning or afternoon tend to work better for you?"
49,Prospect,"Um.. next week, so give me one second. That’s first week of August. Uh.. so I have a board meeting on Tuesday.. Monday is gonna be working towards the board.. so I wouldn't be able to do anything till like, the Thursday or Friday."
49,SDR,"Okay. I can do the Thursday, um.. I have morning or afternoon?"
49,Prospect,Uh.. I have this thing between 9 and 11. So I would have to do the afternoon.
49,SDR,"Okay. I have, uh.. two o'clock if that would be okay?"
49,Prospect,Yup. Two will work.
49,SDR,"Okay. So I have an email for you, is it your first name at company dot com?"
49,Prospect,You got it.
49,SDR,"All right. Perfect. you'll receive that team link through that email as well. And again, um.. that's with our co-founder. His name is Rob. And that's next Thursday, August third at two o’clock. And I am going to put in, um.. in my notes, Uh.. the question that you had, just so he is prepared, to have that answer for you as well."
49,Prospect,Sounds good.
49,SDR,Alright. I hope you have a good rest of your day.
49,Prospect,You too. Thank you. Bye
50,Prospect,This is James.
50,SDR,"Hey, James, this is Jasper. Uh.. please don't hate me. This is a cold call. If you have two minutes, I think you'll like what I have for you."
50,Prospect,Okay. What you got?
50,SDR,"Awesome. Um.. so, I'm with a company called Advanced Selling Systems. We're actually an AI marketing agency that helps door-to-door solar companies recruit more sales reps. Um.. you work for Vivint, right?"
50,Prospect,Yes. Correct.
50,SDR,"Cool. Awesome. Y'all do, uh.. y’all do door to door?"
50,Prospect,"Uh.. yes, sadly. Yeah."
50,SDR,"Um.. it's funny, I actually used to do door-to-door solar back a few years ago. Um.. I kind of felt the same way. But it's really good money, so you can't beat that."
50,Prospect,"Yeah, absolutely."
50,SDR,"Definitely. So yeah, we actually use a combo of Facebook ads, and then we also have an AI chatbot that we've built out for solar companies. And so the Facebook ads get the leads, and then the AI chatbot is what gets them to book onto your calendar so that they can, you know, potential reps can learn more about, like, selling with you guys. Um.. and so, we've worked with a lot of big companies, um.. we've worked with other offices of Vivint, actually. Um.. we've worked with Sunrun, um.. Empower, just some different big companies, and so, um.. we help them get on average, between three to five new sales reps per month, and that's like per company that we work with. So um.. do y’all recruit reps kind of in a similar fashion?"
50,Prospect,"Yeah probably all the same stuff that you've seen before. Um.. I mean, yeah, recruiting’s everything in the door-to-door industry. I'm sure you know, there's a high turnover rate, so.. yeah, I know I'm always looking for new reps. Usually you know, going to college campuses and things like that. But, um.. so two to three per month, is it more local, or is it more, uh.. I guess, like, college-based?"
50,SDR,"No, so it’s actually three to five, um.. new sales reps per month. And yeah, so we actually kind of take advantage, like you were saying, you go to college campuses. Um.. but we kind of replace that with Facebook ads. So you can actually do highly targeted Facebook ads. And, yeah, that is one of our methods, actually, is we run those targeted Facebook ads on college campuses. So everybody’s seeing your ad as a college student. We found that's usually the demographic of people that you're looking to recruit. Um.. and so that's part of what we do, and then the AI chatbot, like I was saying, it’s kind of what follows up with those people for you, and gets them to book, um.. to hear more about what you guys have to offer. But, uh.. yeah, I mean, if your business is similar to the other solar companies that we've worked with, we can definitely do the same for you guys. Um.. it'd be a lot easier to show you what we offer than to tell you about it, just because there's kind of some different moving pieces to it and things like that. But would you be up for, like a 30-minute Zoom call for sometime tomorrow?"
50,Prospect,"Um.. yeah.. one second. Yeah, so afternoon works. Uh.. around two would be okay."
51,SDR,Hi am I reaching the owner of Dallas body contouring?
51,Prospect,Yes.
51,SDR,"Great. So, I'm gonna be honest with you this is a cold call, uh.. so I do have something to pitch to your business. Would you like to hang up now or give me 30 seconds and then you can decide."
51,Prospect,Does this have to do with injectables or something?
51,SDR,"No, no, basically, I checked out your listing on Google, uh, and I saw that you do body sculpting. Is that right?"
51,Prospect,Yes.
51,SDR,"Yeah, so we essentially help uh Medspas with their client acquisition, umm.. so hypothetically, if you'd work with us, we actually handle your entire advertising and appointment setting process, uh so we get you at least 15 prepaid Body Sculpting appointments in your calendar every month or your money back that's our guarantee. So we have essentially uh appointment Setters, uh.. a Team of appointment Setters do the job for you. Does that sound like a fair deal?"
51,Prospect,"Uhm.. I actually handle all of that on my own, for right now, but if I'm ever looking for like a team to expand.. uh.. definitely. But right now I think, I'm okay."
51,SDR,"Okay, um yeah, I mean it's just kind of a service to get, you know, some time off your plate because, uh, yeah, you know, for Med Spas, it's a big thing, like calling the leads, or you know, handling the inquiries and stuff like that."
51,Prospect,What is your company called?
51,SDR,"So we're called inclinerconsulting.com, um yeah, so yeah, like I said, we run your ads, and then um get you a lot of leads from those ads. and then have a team call them and book them into your calendar with Prepaid deposit. so yeah it's basically just guaranteed appointments."
51,Prospect,"Yeah, we're good. We don't need that. Thanks, bye."
52,SDR,Hi am I reaching the owner of Dallas body contouring?
52,Prospect,Yes.
52,SDR,"Great. So, I'm gonna be honest with you this is a cold call, uh.. so I do have something to pitch to your business. Would you like to hang up now or give me 30 seconds and then you can decide."
52,Prospect,Does this have to do with injectables or something?

53,SDR,"Hey, is this Justin?"
53,Prospect,Yes. Who's this?
53,SDR,"Hi Justin, this is Alicia from Remotiv. Do you have a moment to chat?"
53,Prospect,Is this a cold call?
53,SDR,"Yes, it is. Well, I wanted to talk to you because we specialize in helping companies like yours accelerate their sales through fully managed remote sales teams, and I thought it could be a good fit for your team."
53,Prospect,Where did you get my number from?
53,SDR,uh.. I got it from your website.
53,Prospect,Don't lie to me. My number's not listed on our website.
53,SDR,"I'm sorry, I actually got it from the internet."
53,Prospect,Where exactly on the internet? Because I'm pretty sure I haven't posted my number anywhere online.
53,SDR,"Actually, I got it from this website called Rocketreach. It's like a public database with contact details of US companies and executives."
53,Prospect,You mean my number is publicly available?
53,SDR,Yes.. kind of.
53,Prospect,"Well, I would like you to remove my number from your database right away."
53,SDR,"It's not ‘our' database, Justin. It's a third party website and you'll have to talk to them directly to have your info removed. But I'd be happy to help you out. If you want, I can email you all their details and then you can take it from there."
53,Prospect,Sure. I'd appreciate that.
53,SDR,"Alright. And hey, while I have you here, Justin, would you mind if I ask you a couple of questions? I'll be quick, promise."
53,Prospect,"Look, I don't usually take sales calls but, alright, I'll hear you out. Go ahead, shoot."
53,SDR,"Thanks. Well, when I chat with revenue leaders, a lot of them tell me that it's getting harder to convert opportunities lately. Some of them are even struggling to meet quotas because their sales teams aren't performing as well as they'd like. Are you facing any of these issues, or is your sales team closing deals like a well-oiled machine?"
53,Prospect,"Not exactly. We might not have a big sales team, but they do their job well and we're not looking to make any changes with how we do things."
53,SDR,"That's great. I guess you are one of the few revenue leaders who are hitting quotas. Since you have all your ducks in order, do you have any plans of expanding your sales team any time soon to, you know, accelerate your revenue?"
53,Prospect,"No, not at the moment."
53,SDR,"Got it. Well, would it be okay if I drop you some info on our company and how we're helping companies like yours, boost revenue so that in future, whenever you're ready to put fuel on your fire, you would know who to reach out to?"
53,Prospect,"Sure, you can send me your info if you want, but then don't start calling me every week asking if I've read your email. Okay? I get plenty of those spam calls already and don't want you to add on to that. So if I'm interested in your service, I'll reach out to you directly. Understood?"
53,SDR,"Absolutely, hundred percent. I promise I won't spam you, ever. But I hope, Justin, that when things change, you think of me first, before any one else, fair?"
53,Prospect,Alright. I got to go now. Bye.
53,SDR,No problem. Thanks for your time. You have a great day.
53,Prospect,You too. Bye.
54,SDR,"Hey, is this Justin?"
54,Prospect,Yes. Who's this?
54,SDR,"Hi Justin, this is Alicia from Remotiv. Do you have a moment to chat?"
54,Prospect,Is this a cold call?
54,SDR,"Yes, it is. Well, I wanted to talk to you because we specialize in helping companies like yours accelerate their sales through fully managed remote sales teams, and I thought it could be a good fit for your team."
54,Prospect,Where did you get my number from?
54,SDR,uh.. I got it from LinkedIn.
54,Prospect,What nonsense. My number's not listed on LinkedIn.
54,SDR,"I'm sorry, I actually got it from a third party database."
54,Prospect,I want you to get rid of my number and never call me again.
54,SDR,Alright. I’ll do that. You won’t be receiving any calls from us. You have a good one.
55,SDR,"Hey, is this Tom?"
55,Prospect,Who's this?
55,SDR,"Hi Tom, this is Mike from Operatix. How are you doing today?"
55,Prospect,I'm quite busy. Is this a sales call?
55,SDR,"Yes, it is. Well, I wanted to talk to you because we specialize in helping companies like yours with their IT, like with IT consulting, cybersecurity compliance, and training. And I thought it could be a good fit for you too."
55,Prospect,"No, It's not a good fit. IT is not a priority for us right now."
55,SDR,"Oh.. okay. Just curious, how do you manage your IT right now, is it like in-house or outsourced?"
55,Prospect,"I'm not going to tell you that. Look, I already told you I'm busy, and we don't need any IT services. Don't bother me again."
55,SDR,"Okay, no problem. Thanks for your time. Bye."
56,SDR,"Hey, is this Justin?"
56,Prospect,Yes. Who's this?
56,SDR,"Hi Justin, this is Alicia from Remotiv. Do you have a moment to chat?"
56,Prospect,"I'm actually busy working on a deadline, so no, not exactly."
56,SDR,"Well, I wanted to talk to you because we specialize in helping companies like yours accelerate their sales through fully managed remote sales teams, and I thought it could be a good fit for your team."
56,Prospect,"Whatever it is, you email it to me."
56,SDR,"Sure, and can I call you sometime later to see if you have questions."
56,Prospect,"No. If I find it useful, I'll reach out."
56,SDR,"Alright. Very quickly, can I ask you one last question before you go?"
57,Prospect,Hello
57,SDR,"Hey, Rob?"
57,Prospect,Yes
57,SDR,"Hi Rob, this is Fred calling you from Revvspark. Is this a good time to talk?"
57,Prospect,No.
57,SDR,Alright. Should I call you back later?
57,Prospect,What is this regarding?
57,SDR,So I wanted to talk to you because we actually work with companies like yours and help them revamp their marketing to generate a steady stream of inbound traffic. I was wondering if you guys are looking for ways to improve your marketing ROI?
57,Prospect,Not at the moment.
57,SDR,Okay. Quick question: How are you guys managing content creation for your social media profiles?
57,Prospect,"I can't really talk right now. I have to rush for a meeting. So whatever it is that you're offering, you can email it to me."
57,SDR,"Sure. Thank you. Just to confirm I have your email as, is that correct one?"
57,Prospect,Yeah. Bye.
58,SDR,"Hey, is this Mike?"
58,Prospect,Who's this?
58,SDR,"Hi Tom, this is John from Quantic. Did I catch you at a good time?"
58,Prospect,"No, it's not a good time. I'm about to get into a meeting."
58,SDR,"Alright, is it okay if I call you later today or tomorrow?"
58,Prospect,"Not today, but you can call me next week."
58,SDR,Sure. Would you be opposed to putting something on the calendar so I don't do you disservice and call you at the worst possible time?
58,Prospect,I really can't go over this right now. I'm in a rush. But you can probably try again on Thursday or Friday after 2 PM.
58,SDR,That works. Thanks. Have a great day.
58,Prospect,"Yeah, alright. Bye."
59,SDR,"Hi, I'm gonna be honest with you this is a cold call, uh.. so I do have something to pitch to your business. Would you like to hang up now or give me 30 seconds and then you can decide?"
59,Prospect,Not interested.
59,SDR,I was actually calling because I saw your post that you're hiring engineers. I was wondering how does your current recruitment process looks like? Do you have a way to identify most suitable profiles out of the hundred candidates who apply?
59,Prospect,"We're all set. Just take me off your list, will you?"
59,SDR,"Alright, I’ll do that. Have a good day."
60,Prospect,Hello? Can I help you?
60,SDR,"Hey, is Alex or Mark there, please?"
60,Prospect,"Yeah, this is Mark. Who is this?"
60,SDR,"Mark. How's it going, buddy? It's David here calling from RevvSpark."
60,Prospect,From where?
60,SDR,"From RevvSpark, I'm not sure if you've heard of us or not."
60,Prospect,What the hell is RevvSpark?
60,SDR,uh.. we're a marketing agency. But I wanted to get in contact with you and Alex to schedule a business meeting. I know that sounds pretty random..
60,Prospect,"Wait, wait. Did we tell you to call us?"
60,SDR,"No, no, I actually found you guys."
60,Prospect,"Okay, then I'll tell you what you're gonna do. You're gonna go back to unfinding us and hang up the phone and have nothing to do with us, okay?"
60,SDR,"Yeah, sure, Mark, like do you even know what we do at all?"
60,Prospect,"Like, I don't really care what you do, okay? I get these fucking phone calls all day. And I don't really need them. So, just take me off your list."
60,SDR,Sure. Won’t bother you again. Have a good day.
61,SDR,"Hey, Harvey, this is James. And I'm with Denver Property Management. How's Wednesday treating you so far?"
61,Prospect,"You know, I'm not quite sure why I'm getting this call. Tell me why I'm getting this call."
61,SDR,"Yeah, absolutely. One of my colleagues, Michael, gave me your information and said that you were possibly interested in making a switch from your previous property management company."
61,Prospect,Nope. I never told him that. I also told him not to bother me for at least six months. So guess what.. Guess what? Take me off your fucking call list. I don't want you guys to ever call me again. I don't want to have anything to do with your company. How's that?
61,SDR,"Wow, man. Not even if we're able to cut your time and save you some money?"
61,Prospect,I don't care how much…. You know how much money you're costing me by wasting my time with this stupid call?
61,SDR,"Hey, I didn’t mean to upset you, I’m just offering to help."
61,Prospect,I told him specifically I didn't want anybody calling me. I didn't want any contact for at least six months because that's when I'd be ready to make a decision.
61,SDR,"Okay, I got you. I can easily hold off from calling. Bye."
62,Prospect,Hello?
62,SDR,"Hey, James?"
62,Prospect,Yeah.
62,SDR,"Hey, how's it going today?"
62,Prospect,Good.
62,SDR,"Hey, I just wanted to… uh.. I want to make sure you're the person who heads up the marketing at your company and I assume you're the CPO as well, right?"
62,Prospect,What's this regarding?
62,SDR,This is just regarding digital marketing. I just wanted to introduce myself and my company to you.
62,Prospect,I am not interested and I want you to remove me from your list.
62,SDR,"We actually don't have a list to remove you from, James. And I understand nobody likes a cold call, but I actually just wanted to tell you about our software that can like, identify anonymous visitors on your website. It's like, Caller ID for the Internet. Currently, do you have any way of identifying exactly who's visiting your website, and from which company so you probably don't lose any potential hot leads, who are already exploring your product?"
62,Prospect,uhm.. no. Not exactly. But we're doing just fine.
62,SDR,"Well, I'm sure you're doing alright James, but you know what, if you're not converting your website visitors, you're practically leaving money on the table for your competition. So, would it be too crazy, to like chat for a minute or two, just to see how we're helping other companies in your space solve the same problem and see if we're a good fit for your marketing needs, or not? Fair?"
63,SDR,"Hey, we don't know each other. This is technically a cold call. Not sure if you want to throw the phone out of the window or let me explain why it could be relevant."
63,Prospect,I'm not interested. Thank you very much.
63,SDR,What if I did it in an Italian accent?
63,Prospect,"(Laughs) I'm really busy. But very briefly, what is it about?"
63,SDR,"So I'm usually invited by commercial leaders to fix problems like, their sales team is hiding behind LinkedIn and don't want to pick up the phone to make cold calls. Or they do pick up the phone, but they would never have the confidence to put in an accent or make the prospect laugh. I don't know if that rings a bell at all in your world. Otherwise, I'll be on my way."
63,Prospect,"Definitely. Definitely, definitely. I had this exact conversation with one of my team mates earlier this week."
63,SDR,You said definitely three times. It sounds like the type of thing that you're fighting with on a regular basis.
63,Prospect,"Oh, yes! My sales team seems to be frightened of the phone."
63,SDR,"When you say ‘frightened of the phone', is it like that they can't do it or they just point blank don't want to?"
63,Prospect,"They can do it. They prefer not to. Do you know what? Between you and me, I'm actually thinking of firing the lot. But the only reason I haven't is that I don't want to go through this whole hiring and training shenanigan all over again. But if you can get my people cold calling like you are calling, I'd be very happy. Why don't we talk next week, when I have a little more time, and we can speak in detail?"
64,SDR,"Hey, we don't know each other. This is technically a cold call. Not sure if you want to throw the phone out of the window or let me explain why it could be relevant."
64,Prospect,"I'm in the middle of something important. But very briefly, what is it about?"
64,SDR,"So I'm usually invited by commercial leaders to fix problems like, their sales team don't want to pick up the phone to make cold calls. Or they do pick up the phone, but they would never have the confidence to handle objections properly. I don't know if that's a problem you're facing as well, or I'm just barking up the wrong tree?"
65,SDR,"Hey, I'm gonna be completely honest, and you're probably gonna hate me, but this is a sales call. You might wanna throw the phone out of the window or let me have 30 seconds? It's up to you."
65,Prospect,"Yeah, I'm kinda busy at the moment. I'm doing the year-end, so definitely not the time to be taking sales calls, but generally, you can take my number off your database. I don't take unsolicited phone calls."
65,SDR,"I see. Fair enough. Look, I can do that. Do you mind if I briefly explain why I called? And if that's not relevant, you'll never hear from me again anyway."
65,Prospect,Okay. I'll bite. What is this about?
65,SDR,"So I'm usually invited by revenue leaders to fix problems like, their sales team don't want to pick up the phone to make cold calls. Or they do pick up the phone, but they would never have the confidence to handle objections properly. I don't know if that's a problem you're facing as well, or I'm just barking up the wrong tree?"
65,Prospect,"Yeah, we're all set for now. But if you want, you can probably try again in three months."
65,SDR,Alright. Do you mind if I ask a question about that?
65,Prospect,"Okay, what is it?"
65,SDR,"So typically when I hear that, it's either something that's going to change drastically in three months or it's just a very polite way to tell me to go away. Which one is it?"
65,Prospect,"Yeah, actually, it's a little bit the latter, I suppose. The thing is, we've recently hired a sales trainer, yesterday was literally her first day. And we've signed her on for four months. And uhm.. we really don't have the budget for an additional trainer, so you know, it's sort of not on our radar right now, unless, obviously if something goes terrible with our current arrangement."
65,SDR,Okay. One last question - how did you decide to bring in the trainer?
65,Prospect,"Yeah, at the moment, we just started thinking about possible ways to improve our team's performance, and we asked around and got her reference through a connect who's worked with her before."
66,Prospect,"Good afternoon, this is Lisa."
66,SDR,"Good afternoon, Lisa, How are you?"
66,Prospect,Yes. Busy. What's this about?
66,SDR,"I'm Josh, from Contango IT. I'm actually following up an email that I sent you a couple of days earlier, and I was wondering if you got a chance to read it, or I'm not sure if it even reached you?"
66,Prospect,"I'll be honest with you. We're already working with an IT company and really don't have any intention of changing them at this point. So, I probably ignored your email or put it in my ‘I'll contact later folder'."
66,SDR,"I appreciate your honesty, Lisa. And just to be clear, I'm not calling you to propose any changes at the moment. I'm just looking to get some time on your calendar, so we can introduce ourselves. Because we specialize in companies of your size, and we've got hundreds of happy clients, who give us perfect 5-star ratings on Google, and we're also featured in Inc.5000 as fastest growing IT service provider on the east coast. And look, I'm sure you have your IT stuff sorted and as a company we'll be the first ones to tell you that if something's not broken, no need to fix it. So my goal here is to just set up a quick 15-20 minute discovery call with you and my CEO, so we can share how we work with other IT leaders like yours, and whenever in the future, you might be looking for some extra help, you'd know who to turn to. So anytime like, this week, or next to next week, whenever you've got 20 minutes, it'll be great if we can have a quick chat."
66,Prospect,"Yeah, probably within the next couple of months, I'm really not going to have time for that. So, you can put me on early spring maybe, and we can chit-chat, but at this point of time, I've got a lot of things going on, so I'm not gonna be able to make time for that."
66,SDR,"Yeah, that works. I can schedule a quick call for sometime in the first week of November, it’s just a little over two months away. Would that work for you?"
67,Prospect,Hello?
67,SDR,Hey Matt! This is Trent from D and D wholesale supply. How have you been?
67,Prospect,"Good, how are you doing?"
67,SDR,"That's great to hear. I’m doing really well this afternoon. I appreciate you asking. I'm happy it's Friday, so you know.. excited for the weekend. The reason I was giving you a call, Matt, is we had spoken earlier in this week and you had mentioned that you oversee the purchasing of the prescription vials and that y’all use the Rexam automation today, um it seemed like you weren't interested in comparing the cost because you had hung up but I wanted to see if you'd be open to reviewing costs on the vials to see if there might be any savings on the table?"
67,Prospect,"Yeah like I said the.. the.. uh stuff that we use.. so we can only use the two brands and that's it. Um.. if you don't have Rexam or.. um..  I can't remember what the other name is, then we can't use it."
67,SDR,"I understand and if that's the case, then I certainly would understand that we couldn't help, but I know that there was a patent on those vials. Do you know if y'all are using the one-click or the thumb tab vials?"
67,Prospect,um.. they’re the regular.. regular twist top style.
67,SDR,"Regular twist top? Because what we find is that most customers are using either reversible vials, which is the child-resistant and the screw cap on one side, or just the screw cap or the child-resistant, and although those two brands do have the automation systems, they are compliant with mostly every vial in the industry, it's usually pretty standard. So I know that may be what was told, but with that being said, would you be open to perhaps just comparing costs to see if it may make sense for us to send you samples, because we'd love to validate if that's true or not, because we think that there could be a lot of savings on the table?"
67,Prospect,"Yeah, but the problem is that as soon as anything goes wrong.. they'll blame you guys, and it's the same reason that we buy other stuff that is only from the people that they tell us.. if anything goes wrong on that machine, they're going to say, “You didn't put the right vial.”. They’re gonna pull the vials out and say you put the wrong vials in."
67,SDR,Right. And have you tried that in the past?
67,Prospect,"Yeah, so.. um.. we were actually gonna have our own vials made, um.. from a plastics company locally, and we weren't able to do it because of that."
67,SDR,"Interesting and.. and.. did you have them.. like, did they supply you product and then you just.. you didn't put it in the machine because you were concerned that it could break the machine and that would be a fiasco?"
67,Prospect,"Right. They have.. what they have is they have um.. little eyes in there, that sense if there's a vial there or not. And even to go from, like.. the Rexam brand amber.. to the Rexam brand green um.. because we use the green vials only, um.. you know they have to adjust the machine for that. So, I mean, what it comes down to, those are the only two brands that they say are covered in their.. in their machinery."
67,SDR,"Right, that makes sense. And because we've done this with other customers, it does require a configuration of the machine, so that may not be worth the effort, but if you did look into directly manufacturing through a plastic manufacturer yourself, I'm curious why that was; because that's exactly what we do, we've been in the business 18 years. All we do is make pharmaceutical containers, so vials, bottles, other items like that. And we've done this with other customers it just requires a reconfiguration of the machine. Rexam will of course, say 'hey you can't use any other product.' because they want you to keep buying their vials."
67,Prospect,"But it's not Rexam, it's Parata.. the company that makes the robots. It's not Rexam; it's the actual company that makes the robot tells us - here's a list of who you can use."
67,SDR,"Right, and it would make sense for them to have a curated list of partners so they can continue to reinforce that barrier of entry. That’s their way to ensure you stay with them. But I can understand the hesitation, and look, I’m not asking you to change anything right away. I mean, if the cost savings aren’t significant enough, then it makes no sense to go down that road. That being said, and we’ve seen with other pharmacies like yours that once they compared the costs, it turned out they were overpaying by 20 to 50 thousand dollars. So all I’m trying to say here is that I can send you a quick quote so you can compare it with what you’re paying right now for just vials alone, and if you find that there is a significant difference, then we can talk further. Fair?"
67,Prospect,"Alright, you can email it to me. I’ll have a look."
68,Prospect,This is Haley.
68,SDR,Hi Haley! This is Trent from Qualtrics. How are you?
68,Prospect,"I'm sorry, from where?"
68,SDR,"My name is Trent, and I'm calling from Qualtrics. May I have 30 seconds for me to tell you the reason why I'm calling you this morning, Haley?"
68,Prospect,30 seconds. Go ahead.
68,SDR,"Appreciate it, Start the timer! Well, the reason I was giving you a call, Haley, is I noticed that you were a leader of HR and People over at Zions Bank, and I typically work with folks like yourself, to help them increase Employee Engagement, retention of their employees, productivity development, and more. Are any of those outcomes top of mind for your team today?"
68,Prospect,"Yup, of course."
68,SDR,"I imagine they were. 91 of the top 100 Banks today use Qualtrics for their employee feedback programs. I have a few different ideas I believe we can help your team, but I would love the opportunity to set up a brief introductory conversation and talk about how your process is working today, and allow me to share how Qualtrics could help."
68,Prospect,"Right now, we have a team that handles that in-house, we are good for now."
68,SDR,"Being that your team values insights like these today, certainly not expecting you all to be interested in changing anything anytime soon. Really just looking to share, well, hey.. could Qualtrics bring additional value to this program, especially if you have a team focused on this, or perhaps even be a better fit in the long term? Um.. really my ask would be, when would be an appropriate time to talk more about the results that program is driving and allow me to share how Qualtrics could bring additional impact?"
68,Prospect,"I appreciate the call, but I’m not interested."
68,SDR,"Sure, and out of respect for your time, Haley, would there be a more appropriate member of the team, that perhaps oversees this process directly, because if this doesn't fall in your wheelhouse, I certainly don't want to bother you if this isn't something I can help your team with."
68,Prospect,"No, I’m the right person, but we are all set for now. Maybe in a couple years, or down the road."
68,SDR,"Totally hear where you're coming from, Haley. if I may ask as a final question here, is the hesitation due to, “Well, hey we're under a contract with another vendor” or things are just working so spectacularly well. I'm just curious, the reasoning as to why, maybe a few years from now would be better, opposed to in the near term?"
68,Prospect,"Yeah, the thing is, we have those kinds of processes in place already, and we’ve been using them for quite some time, so we’re not really looking to upend something that’s working alright, just to try a shiny new software."
68,SDR,"Yeah, I get that, and I'm sure that the process are working well today. I just typically find with other HR leaders I work with, although things may be working well, there's usually room for improvement or lead to cost savings and typically learning about industry trends as to what and, we empower your teams with the tool, so it's not, “hey, let's take all the work away from your team.” We're going to give you access to the resources to drive the outcomes for the things that your team's focused on. So, not expecting y'all to change anything, really just looking to educate and share how we might be able to bring supplemental value or be a better fit for your team."
68,Prospect,"Yeah, that’s fine, but it’s just not something we need, so right now is not the right time for us."
68,SDR,Alright. No issues. I appreciate you taking the time to talk. Is it okay if I check in again in six months to see if anything has changed?
69,Prospect,This is Karen.
69,SDR,Hey Karen! This is Trent from D and D wholesale supply. How are you?
69,Prospect,What’s this about?
69,SDR,"Well, the reason I was giving you a call Karen is, I noticed that you oversee the purchasing at your company, and I wanted to talk with you about the purchasing of vials. Because we're a manufacturer and distributor of prescription containers, so all we do is vials, bottles, other items like that. We work with Pharmerica, and other customers in your space today. I was wondering if you would be interested in comparing the costs to see if we can help you save money or provide some other value-add solution for your team."
69,Prospect,No. but I’m wondering how did you get my information directly? Because I do not oversee the purchasing for my company. So information do you have about me?
69,SDR,"Yeah, I was just looking over at your LinkedIn page, and I saw that you’re title is the strategic sourcing team lead and I have this tool called Apollo, and it helps find me direct numbers and phones so I just wanted to reach out myself and see if I can find whoever oversees the purchasing of vials, and see if we can help you’ll save some money."
69,Prospect,"Yeah, so we would have to treat this as a solicitation call. So there’s no guarantee that there would be any interest with your company, especially following me from Linkedin. So this is now strictly a solicitation."
69,SDR,Sure. And I totally understand. I believe it’s a pretty common practice. I’ll make sure to follow your advice. It feels like that item doesn’t fall in your wheelhouse. Would you be able to help me out and recommend who might be the right person who oversees the purchasing of vials?
70,Prospect,"Hello, this is Mike."
70,SDR,Hey Mike. This is Michael with Vouris. How you doing today?
70,Prospect,I’m all right. Which company are you with?
70,SDR,I’m with Vouris. I know I'm calling you out of the blue here. Do you happen to have 30 seconds for me to explain why I’m calling you today?
70,Prospect,Ok.
70,SDR,"Cool. Thanks for the time. So I'm calling you because we work with early-stage companies to build, scale, and optimize their outbound sales efforts, and we typically work with companies that are in one of two situations. They’re either starting to build an inside sales team, or their current team isn't producing the results they're looking for. Do either one of these resonate with you?"
70,Prospect,"Okay, yeah, you can just email me."
70,SDR,"Yeah, sure.. umm.. I wanna make sure that email’s relevant to you. Are you currently focused on either of the two things I mentioned?"
70,Prospect,Yes.
70,SDR,"Yeah, just send me an email with what you offer."
70,SDR,Um.. what do you mean by that? Like all our product offers?
70,Prospect,Yes.
70,SDR,Sure. What would be the best email to send you the info?
71,Prospect,This is Jean.
71,SDR,"Hi Jean, it's Steve from Synth Software. How are you?"
71,Prospect,I’m busy. What’s this about?
71,SDR,I actually wanted to talk to you about our new cloud management software. Would you have 30 seconds for me?
71,Prospect,Okay. You got 30 seconds. Go ahead.
71,SDR,Great. So it’s basically a plug-and-play system that connects with your existing cloud infrastructure..
71,Prospect,Alright. I’ll stop you right there. It doesn't sound like anything that I would understand or know about or care about.
71,SDR,"Actually, if you just gave me some time to explain how it works, you might care about it too."
71,Prospect,"Look, Steve, I don't even know where you're from, and, honestly, I don’t really talk with salespeople. Plus, I’m very busy right now, so why don’t you leave your number and I’ll get back to you when I can?"
71,SDR,Sure. Is it okay if I drop you an email with my info and what we offer? If you find it useful you can just reply to the email. Alright?
72,Prospect,This is Fred.
72,SDR,Hey Fred. This is Vin with DemandBase. How are you?
72,Prospect,"Hey, what’s up man?"
72,SDR,"Not much, not much. So, I sent you an email. I saw you were coming to the site. I work with a company called DemandBase, uh.. and we kind of help salespeople identify which account they should focus on first."
72,Prospect,"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I know what you guys do. We use 6Sense. I don't need it, man."
72,SDR,"Got it. Yeah no worries. Yeah, that's kind of why I'm giving you a call. I know you guys use 6Sense. How's it been going with adoption, with the sales team?"
72,Prospect,"it's going all right. I'm trying to figure out all of the false positives and stuff like that, too. So, we're grinding through it."
72,SDR,"That's good. Yeah and I'll let you go. I know I called you out of the blue. 6Sense is a great company. The one thing I did wanted to.. really, the reason I was reaching out because, with your website in particular, you guys have a lot of freelance traffic, and that's not really B2B traffic. And that could create a lot of noise with a platform like 6Sense, because they don't really have the ability to kind of parse out that B2C traffic. So with DemandBase, you know, I worked with the company like ZocDoc, they have millions of consumers coming to their site, uh.. they also have a B2B side of the house, we help them kind of parse out that traffic, to make sure that the scores are a bit more accurate, and the sales team can trust the actual scores that they're getting."
72,Prospect,"Yeah, that's interesting man. I mean look, like you can.. uh.. you're welcome to hunt down the.. the.. you know, the marketing folks. So marketing owns that sales intelligence stuff, right, and then they just kind of throw me.. uh, spreadsheets and shit every now and then to take a look at, but you know, uh.. ultimately your decision makers are.. are people in marketing. People like Debby. If you wanted to get feelers out on those guys, you obviously could try that."
72,SDR,"Yeah for sure. I'll definitely, uh.. reach out. Would it be cool, if I let them know that I spoke with you?"
72,Prospect,"Yeah, that's fine."
73,Prospect,Hello?
73,SDR,"Hello, is it Jenny?"
73,Prospect,Who am I talking to?
73,SDR,"Talking to Alan, calling from a company called Swordfish. Um.. look, you don't know me. It is a cold call. I was hoping for 30 seconds, if that's okay."
73,Prospect,"Oh.. I'm getting ready to go into a meeting, Alan. What would you like?"
73,SDR,"Cool. I'll make it quick for you. Um.. what I do.. I currently work with a lot of recruiting functions and sales functions. Companies similar to the one you're working for and.. uh.. in short, I help them have more conversations, with the right people, more frequently. So.. I wanted to ask, if I could show you a tool or a strat that could, let's say at minimum, double the pipeline you generate. Would you be willing to entertain a further discussion?"
73,Prospect,"So, Alan.. I’m, um.. just pretty much a very honest, blunt person and, um.. because of your accent, I can't really understand you over the phone. So, I only picked up every other word of what you're trying to say. And, uh.. I mean, I don't mind talking to you about whatever it is you're trying to sell, but um.. I can't do it right this second. Because I'm getting ready to go into a meeting myself. To sell ‘my company’. If you catch my drift."
73,SDR,"Okay. Look, I completely understand. I know, you're sort of quite tight for time. Um.. what I'd like to go ahead and do, do you have two minutes for me to explain.. what I do?"
73,Prospect,"I don’t. I'm pulling in the parking lot. Um.. so I really don't. However, since you’re a persistent one.. I’ll hear you out. Um.. You can call me tomorrow. I will be in the office, so I might have some time for you, and I'll be able to hear you better and understand what you're selling, as well. Okay?"
73,SDR,I can do that. What time do you want me to call?
73,Prospect,Anytime in the afternoon.. should be fine. After 2 PM. Um.. I’m usually done with most of my meetings by then.
74,Prospect,This is Desiree.
74,SDR,"Hey, Desiree. This is Trent from Qualtrics. How are you?"
74,Prospect,"I'm a little busy right now, Trent. I wasn’t going to pick up, but I thought you were someone else."
74,SDR,"Oh, sorry if I caught you at a bad time. Would it be fair, if I'd give you a quick call back sometime later today?"
74,Prospect,Um.. uh.. maybe next week?
74,SDR,"Yeah, absolutely. And the reason I was calling Desiree, is to discuss your employee engagement, employee feedback initiatives. Um.. would that be a relevant conversation to chat about for maybe two minutes sometime next week?"
74,Prospect,"Uh.. um.. I mean, I guess. But I can tell you that we don't have any budget to turn anything on in Qualtrics, from an employee engagement perspective."
74,SDR,"Okay. Well, that's totally fair. Definitely not asking for any budget, at this point, I'm just curious, do you all plan to do any employee feedback this year?"
74,Prospect,"Yes. But um.. in a very very, ‘very’ budget-friendly way. We have our own homegrown program, we'll call it that."
74,SDR,"Okay. Well, I know you have to hop here Desiree. And Um.. attended a webinar disrupting tech's growing gender gap with Qualtrics and really, what I'm hearing from other HR leaders, is remote work and well-being engagement are really top of mind to drive retention, other business outcomes. And homegrown solutions can work, but typically are low impact and that's the reason why thirteen thousand customers use Qualtric today to drive these outcomes in their business. There of course, is a cost with that, but typically, can drive a pretty, big business impact, and if this falls within your wheelhouse? I'd love the opportunity for a brief introductory conversation, especially if it is a priority?"
74,Prospect,"Um.. it is a priority um and I, uh.. actually have already had a kind of, introductory meeting with someone else, and really, uh.. the only thing that’s um.. not making us interested is that budget."
74,SDR,"Well we absolutely can get creative. Um.. hypothetically, is there a potential number, like, hey, we need to stay within this stratosphere, or it wouldn't even be possible because I've definitely seen situations where we can get really creative, and of course, I don't want to get ahead of myself with just pure pricing, but we definitely have options that align with programs that are, less than their maturity but also provide the impact that could be greater than a home-grown program?"
74,Prospect,"I mean, yeah, that number’s zero. I know we use something similar for our customer engagement, and I know our customer executive is actually, um.. kind of working on a project right now with that side of the house and how the relation of employee satisfaction is with our customer satisfaction and we're doing that comparison essentially with our own homegrown, um.. employee satisfaction and feedback and all of that that we do. Um.. so we aren’t really looking to utilize anything like Qualtrics at the moment. But, um.. I don't know maybe next year, but definitely not anytime soon at all."
74,SDR,"Alright. No problem. I understand that it’s not a priority right now. Would it be okay, if I reach out again in, say, 6 months just to reconnect and see if anything’s changed?"
75,SDR,"Hey mate, this John, how are you?"
75,Prospect,Don’t call me mate. I’m not your mate. I don’t even know you.
75,SDR,"Sure, would you be open to having a conversation to see if we can help out at least lead generation or bring in new people in, helping train your salespeople?"
75,Prospect,"Not particularly, no."
75,SDR,"Alright, mate. Are you open to me sending you an email, with some info?"
75,Prospect,It’d be a waste of your time.
75,SDR,"Alright, how about a LinkedIn connection request? Can I get you on Linkedin?"
75,Prospect,"If you can find me, sure."
75,SDR,"Last question, before I go. How are you guys handling your lead generation at the moment? Is it like all in-house or do you use some agencies as well?"
75,Prospect,"We do a whole lot of what’s called none of your business, 'mate'."
75,SDR,Got it. Well it was real nice chatting with you. You have a good day now.

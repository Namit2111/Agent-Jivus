# Python File Documentation

This Python file loads configuration variables from a `config` object (presumably loaded from a configuration file, like a `.yaml` or `.json` file via the `src.config` module).  It then checks if certain key variables are loaded successfully.

## Variables

* **`GROQ_API`**:  A string containing the GROQ API key. Loaded from `config["GROQ_API"]`.
* **`OPENAI_API_KEY`**: A string containing the OpenAI API key. Loaded from `config["OPENAI_API_KEY"]`.
* **`AUTH_TOKEN`**: A string containing a VAPI authentication token. Loaded from `config["VAPI_AUTH_TOKEN"]`.
* **`PHONE_NUMBER_ID`**:  A string or integer representing a phone number ID. Loaded from `config["PHONE_NUMBER_ID"]`.
* **`HEADERS`**: A dictionary containing HTTP headers for API requests.  Includes `Authorization` with a Bearer token and `Content-Type`.
* **`VAPI_CALL_URL`**: A string representing the base URL for VAPI calls. Loaded from `config["VAPI_CALL_URL"]`.
* **`assistant_id`**: A string or integer representing the ID of a VAPI assistant. Loaded from `config["VAPI_ASSISTANT_ID"]`.
* **`NEBULA_API`**: A string containing the Nebula API key (Note: there's a typo in the code: `NUBELA_API_KEY` is used in the variable name, but `NEBULA_API` is used in the config). Loaded from `config["NUBELA_API_KEY"]`.
* **`test_vars`**: A list of strings representing the variable names that need to be checked for successful loading.

## Configuration Check

The script iterates through `test_vars` and prints a message indicating whether each corresponding configuration variable was loaded successfully.  If a variable is `None`, it prints an error message; otherwise, it prints a success message including the value of the variable.


## Potential Improvements

* **Error Handling:** The script could be improved by handling potential `KeyError` exceptions that might occur if a key in `config` is missing.
* **Logging:** Instead of printing to the console, consider using a more robust logging system for better error management and debugging.
* **Typo Correction:**  The variable name `NEBULA_API` should be consistent with the key used in `config`, which appears to be `NUBELA_API_KEY`.  This should be corrected for clarity and proper functionality.
* **Clarity on `src.config`:** Add a comment explaining the source and format of the `config` object.  For instance, mention if it's loaded from a YAML or JSON file.


This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the file's functionality and its variables.  Addressing the mentioned improvements would enhance the robustness and maintainability of the code.

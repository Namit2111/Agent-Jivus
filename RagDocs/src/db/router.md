# `src/routes.py` Documentation

This file defines the main API routes for the application using FastAPI and MongoEngine.  It connects to a MongoDB database and includes several sub-routers for managing different data resources.

## Imports

* `from src.config import config`: Imports application configuration settings from `src.config`.
* `from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends`: Imports necessary components from the FastAPI framework for creating routers and dependency injection.
* `from mongoengine import connect`: Imports the `connect` function from MongoEngine for establishing a database connection.
* `from src.db.subroutes import (conversations, live_insights, personas, summaries, transcripts, prompts)`: Imports sub-routers for various data resources (conversations, live insights, personas, summaries, transcripts, and prompts).  These sub-routers presumably handle specific CRUD operations for each resource.
* `from src.utils.auth import get_auth_response`: Imports an authentication function (`get_auth_response`) to handle authentication for all API requests.


## Database Connection

```python
connect(db=config["DB_NAME"], host=config["DB_URI"])
```

Establishes a connection to the MongoDB database using configuration parameters from `config["DB_NAME"]` (database name) and `config["DB_URI"]` (database URI).

## API Router

```python
router = APIRouter(prefix="/v1", dependencies=[Depends(get_auth_response)])
```

Creates a FastAPI router with the following characteristics:

* **`prefix="/v1"`**: All routes defined within this router will have the `/v1` prefix.  This suggests versioning of the API.
* **`dependencies=[Depends(get_auth_response)]`**:  All routes within this router require authentication.  The `get_auth_response` dependency will be executed for each request.

## Sub-router Inclusion

The following lines include the various sub-routers, effectively mounting them under the `/v1` prefix:

```python
router.include_router(conversations.router)
router.include_router(live_insights.router)
router.include_router(personas.router)
router.include_router(summaries.router)
router.include_router(transcripts.router)
router.include_router(prompts.router)
```

Each sub-router likely defines its own set of API endpoints for managing its specific data resource.


## Usage

This file is likely used as a central point to define and organize all API routes for the application.  It's expected to be imported and used by a FastAPI application's main file to serve the API.  The authentication mechanism ensures that all requests are authenticated before accessing the database resources.

# API Router Documentation

This Python file defines a FastAPI router for interacting with a MongoDB database.  It leverages several modules for configuration, authentication, and database interaction.

## Imports

* `from src.config import config`: Imports the application configuration settings.  `config` is assumed to contain database connection details (`DB_NAME`, `DB_URI`).
* `from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends`: Imports necessary components from the FastAPI framework for creating and managing API routes.
* `from mongoengine import connect`: Imports the `connect` function from the `mongoengine` ODM (Object Document Mapper) for connecting to the MongoDB database.
* `from src.db.subroutes import (conversations, live_insights, personas, summaries, transcripts, prompts)`: Imports sub-routers, each presumably managing a specific collection or aspect of the database.
* `from src.utils.auth import get_auth_response`: Imports an authentication function that likely handles authentication and authorization for API requests.

## Database Connection

```python
connect(db=config["DB_NAME"], host=config["DB_URI"])
```

Establishes a connection to the MongoDB database using the credentials from the `config` object.

## API Router

```python
router = APIRouter(prefix="/v1", dependencies=[Depends(get_auth_response)])
```

Creates a FastAPI router with the following characteristics:

* **`prefix="/v1"`:**  All routes defined within this router will have the `/v1` prefix (indicating API version 1).
* **`dependencies=[Depends(get_auth_response)]`:**  Requires authentication for all routes within this router.  Each request will be processed by `get_auth_response` before reaching the route handler.

## Sub-router Inclusion

```python
router.include_router(conversations.router)
router.include_router(live_insights.router)
router.include_router(personas.router)
router.include_router(summaries.router)
router.include_router(transcripts.router)
router.include_router(prompts.router)
```

Includes several sub-routers, each presumably responsible for a specific API endpoint:

* `conversations`:  Likely handles API endpoints related to conversations.
* `live_insights`:  Likely handles API endpoints related to live insights or real-time data.
* `personas`:  Likely handles API endpoints related to personas or user profiles.
* `summaries`:  Likely handles API endpoints related to summaries or data aggregation.
* `transcripts`: Likely handles API endpoints related to transcripts or conversation logs.
* `prompts`: Likely handles API endpoints related to prompts or user inputs.


This file provides a high-level structure for an API.  Detailed documentation for each sub-router (`conversations`, `live_insights`, etc.) would be needed to fully understand the API's functionality.

Please provide the Python file content.  I need the code to generate the markdown documentation.  I can then create a markdown file that includes:

* **Module-level documentation:**  A description of the overall purpose of the module.
* **Function/Class documentation:**  For each function and class, I'll extract the docstrings (if present) and format them nicely.  If there are no docstrings, I'll try to infer the purpose from the code (this will be less accurate).
* **Parameter and Return Value Documentation:** I'll extract information about function parameters and return values from the docstrings or code.
* **Example Usage:**  If the docstrings provide examples, I'll include them.

Once you give me the code, I will produce a well-formatted markdown documentation.

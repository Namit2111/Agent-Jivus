Please provide the file content of the Python file.  I need the code to generate a Markdown documentation for it.  I can then create a documentation that includes:

* **Module description:** A brief overview of the file's purpose.
* **Function/Class documentation:**  For each function and class, I will extract docstrings (if present) and add information about parameters, return values, and exceptions.
* **Example usage:**  If appropriate, I can include example code snippets.


Once you provide the code, I'll generate the Markdown documentation for you.

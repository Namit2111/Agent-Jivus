# `conversation_create_req.py` Documentation

This file defines a Pydantic model for creating a conversation.  Pydantic provides data validation and parsing.

## `ConversationCreateReq` Class

This class represents the request body for creating a new conversation.  It uses the `BaseModel` from the `pydantic` library to enforce data validation.

**Attributes:**

* `conversationId: str`:  A string representing the unique identifier for the conversation.  This is required.
* `personaId: str`: A string representing the unique identifier for the persona involved in the conversation. This is required.


**Example Usage:**

```python
from conversation_create_req import ConversationCreateReq

# Valid request
create_req = ConversationCreateReq(conversationId="conv_123", personaId="persona_456")

# Invalid request (missing conversationId)
try:
    invalid_req = ConversationCreateReq(personaId="persona_789")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error creating invalid request: {e}") # This will raise a ValidationError

```

Migrate an existing ecommerce bridge API integration
Migrate an existing Ecommerce Bridge API integration
API keys will be sunsetted
on November 30th, 2022. If your Ecommerce Bridge integration uses API keys, you will need to update it to a
private app
, then implement the following API changes below.
Migrating contact, product, deal & line items sync
Learn about the different APIs you can use for the contact, product, deal and line items sync. The respective API documentation includes details on relevant scope requirements.
For contact sync, you can instead use the
Contacts API
. Specifically, you can make
GET
,
POST
,
PATCH
,
DELETE
requests to
/crm/v3/objects/contacts
.
For product sync, you can instead use the
Products API
. Specifically, you can make
GET
,
POST
,
PATCH
,
DELETE
requests to
/crm/v3/objects/products
.
For deal sync, you can instead use the
Deals API
. Specifically, you can use make
GET
,
POST
,
PATCH
,
DELETE
requests to
/crm/v3/objects/deals
.
For line item sync you can instead use the
Line Items API
. Specifically, you can make
GET
,
POST
,
PATCH
,
DELETE
requests to
/crm/v3/objects/line_items
.
In addition to creating and maintaining these objects, you will also need to establish the relationships between them using the
Associations API
. You can create associations by making a
PUT
request to
/crm/v3/objects/associations
. For example, you associate contacts to deals, or line items to deals and products.
The above APIs do not automatically retry if they return errors. If your integration experiences errors interacting with the above APIs your system will need to retry API calls.
Please note:
when using the products, deals, and line items API, deduplication will not happen automatically. When you create an object using one of these APIs, you should record the ID so you know when to update existing products, deals, or line items instead of creating new ones.
Migrating the external object id
The Ecommerce Bridge API used the
externalObjectId
field to sync objects. Moving forward, you should maintain the HubSpot record IDs for each record in your internal system.
For product, deals, and line items, you can also
create a unique identifier
for your records and use this identifier when creating and updating records. When creating this unique identifier, make sure to set the
hasUniqueValue
field to
true
so that any records created in the future will not have the same value. Learn more about
creating unique identifiers
.
Migrating ecommerce properties
Any properties prefixed with _ip__ecomm_bridge___ will remain in existing users' HubSpot accounts, but for net new integrations, developers will need to use the
Properties API
to define their own properties.
The following properties were created automatically in your account when using the Ecommerce Bridge API:
Contact
Ecommerce contact
Source store
Deal
Abandoned cart URL
Discount savings
Ecommerce deal
Order number
Shipment IDs
Source store
Tax price
Product
Ecommerce product
Image URL
Source store
Migrating import API
For import, you can instead use the
Import API
. Specifically, you can make a
POST
request to
/crm/v3/imports/
.
Migrating ecommerce pipeline
Pipelines are a
paid feature
. With this sunset, there will no longer be an option to create a
free
ecommerce pipeline in every account. Moving forward, ecommerce pipelines can only be created in accounts that have not reached its pipeline limit. If the ecommerce pipeline has already been created in a user's account, when the API is sunsetted that pipeline will
not be removed
. Developers should use the
Pipeline API
to find all existing pipelines and continue to sync deals in that existing pipeline. Specifically, you can make a
GET
request to
/crm/v3/pipelines/deal
.
Or, you can store the ecommerce tag or pipeline name in a property on the deal record.
Please note:
if you attempt to create a pipeline in a free account, you will receive the following error:
context:{maximum pipelines:["1" ]},category:"API_LIMIT"}.
Migrating VAST email templates
HubSpot sunsetted VAST email templates in 2021. As a result, these templates will also be sunsetted for the Ecommerce Bridge API.
New customer email template
If you're a
Marketing Hub
Professional
or
Enterprise
user, you can add the
product module in-app
to marketing emails. Or you can create a coded file with the email template type using the
Template overview documentation
. Make sure to publish the email template so it is available to use when creating emails.
Re-engaging email template
You can create a coded file with the email template type using this
Template overview documentation
.
Abandon cart email template
The
Abandoned cart
module
only works when using the
Shopify integration
, and is
not
currently supported when building a custom integration.
Migrating the ecommerce dashboard
The ecommerce dashboard and template will be sunsetted for
net new users
. Accounts that already have a ecommerce dashboard or the ecommerce dashboard template can still use it, but can no longer create an ecommerce template via open APIs.
Moving forward, learn how to build
reports
and
dashboards
in HubSpot.
Migrating embedded workflows
The
Customer welcome
,
Abandon cart
, and
Re-engaging customer
embedded workflow, will also be sunsetted.
To create workflows, you can instead use the
Create & Manage Workflows API
. Specifically, you can make a POST request to
/automation/v3/workflows
.
Please note:
you cannot recreate the abandon cart workflow using the workflows API because it does not support deal-based workflows.
Ecommerce settings page in app
The
Ecommerce
navigation item in the side menu and the ecommerce settings page will be sunsetted.
As partners move their integrations to public apps, their apps will then be listed on the
Connected Apps
page.
If developers would like to have a settings page for their integration they can build one using the
Settings App API
.

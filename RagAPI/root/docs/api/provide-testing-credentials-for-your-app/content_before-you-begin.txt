Provide testing credentials for your app
Valid testing credentials must be provided to
list
or
certify
your app on the HubSpot App Marketplace. This is necessary for the HubSpot Product team to verify listing and certification requirements, and also recommend areas for improvement.
Before you begin
Review the following questions to find the appropriate instructions for providing testing credentials to the HubSpot Product team:
Does your app with HubSpot require an account for a platform/application/service other than HubSpot?
If
yes
, (i.e. at least one other account is required), proceed to question 2.
If
no
, follow the steps listed
here
.
Are you able to give HubSpot Product team members access to
all
platforms/applications/services required to use your app?
If
yes
, (i.e. you are able to give HubSpot Product team members access to needed platforms/applications/services), follow the steps listed
here
.
If
no
, (i.e. you are
not able
to give HubSpot Product team members access to at least one platform/application/service), follow the steps listed
here
.

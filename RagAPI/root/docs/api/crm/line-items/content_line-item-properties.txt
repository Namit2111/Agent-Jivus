CRM API | Line items
Line Items
Line items endpoint reference
In HubSpot, line items are individual instances of
products
. When a product is attached to a deal, it becomes a line item. You can create line items that are unique to an individual quote, but they will not be added to your product library. The line items endpoints allow you to manage this data and sync it between HubSpot and other systems.
Example use case:
when creating a set of
quotes
for sales reps to send to potential buyers, you can use this API to create standalone line items per quote, as well as line items that are attached to existing products.
Create a line item
To create a line item, make a
POST
request to
/crm/v3/objects/line_items
. In the post body, include the line item's details, such as name, quantity, and price.
To create a line item based on an existing product (created through the
products API
or
in HubSpot
), include
hs_product_id
in the post body.
You can also associate the line item with deals, quotes, invoices, payment links or subscriptions, by including an
associations
array in the post body. For example, the post body below would create a line item named "New standalone line item" that's associated with a deal (ID:
12345
).
Copy code snippet
// Example POST request body to https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/line_item
{
"properties": {
"price": 10,
"quantity": 1,
"name": "New standalone line item"
},
"associations": [
{
"to": {
"id": 12345
},
"types": [
{
"associationCategory": "HUBSPOT_DEFINED",
"associationTypeId": 20
}
]
}
]
}

Please note:
Line items belong to one single parent object. If associating objects, line items should be individual to each object. For example, if you're creating a deal and a quote, you should create one set of line items for the deal, and another set for the quote. This will help streamline CRM data across objects and prevent unexpected data loss when needing to modify line items (e.g., deleting a quote will delete the quote's line items, and if those line items are associated with a deal, the deals line items will also be deleted).
The
price
specified within the
properties
field
cannot
be negative.
The line items
Term
property (
hs_recurring_billing_period
) accepts
ISO-8601 period formats
of PnYnMnD and PnW.
Retrieve a line item
You can retrieve line items individually or in bulk.
To retrieve a specific line item, make a
GET
request to
/crm/v3/objects/line_items/{lineItemId}
where
lineItemId
is the ID of the line item.
To retrieve all line items, make a
GET
request to
/crm/v3/objects/line_items
.
In the request URL, you can include the following parameters:
Parameter
Description
properties
A comma separated list of the properties to be returned in the response. If any of the specified properties are not present on the requested object(s), they will be ignored.
propertiesWithHistory
A comma separated list of the properties to be returned along with their history of previous values. If any of the specified properties are not present on the requested object(s), they will be ignored.
Update a line item
To update a line item, make a
PATCH
request to
/crm/v3/objects/line_items/{lineItemId}
, where
lineItemId
is the ID of the line item.
In the post body, include the property values that you want to update. You
cannot
update associations through this method. Instead you'll need to use the
associations API
.
For example, your request body might look similar to the following:
Copy code snippet
// PATCH request to https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/line_item/{lineItemId}
{
"properties": {
"price": 25,
"quantity": 3,
"name": "Updated line item"
}

, where

is the ID of the line item.

When managing your line item data, you may want to use some of the common properties in the table below. To get all line item properties, make a

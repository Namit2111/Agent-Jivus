Postal Mail
Postal mail endpoint reference
Use the postal mail engagement API to log and manage postal mail on CRM records. You can log the mail you've sent or received
in HubSpot
or through the postal mail API. You can also retrieve, update, or delete existing postal mail engagements.
Below, learn the basic methods of managing postal mail through the API. To view all available endpoints and their requirements, click the
Endpoints
tab at the top of this article.
Create a postal mail engagement
To create a postal mail engagement, make a
POST
request to
/crm/v3/objects/postal_mail
.
In the request body, add postal mail details in a
properties
object. You can also add an
associations
object to associate your new postal mail with an existing record (e.g., contacts, companies).
Properties
In the properties object, you can include the following fields:
Field
Description
hs_timestamp
The date that the postal mail was sent or received.
hs_postal_mail_body
The body text of the postal mail engagement.
hubspot_owner_id
The ID of the user that created the postal mail engagement.
hs_attachment_ids
The IDs of any attachments to the postal mail engagement. Multiple attachment IDs are separated by a semi-colon.
Associations
To create and associate a postal mail engagement with existing records, include an associations object in your request. For example, to create postal mail and associate it with two contacts, your request body might look similar to the following:
Copy code snippet
//Example request body
{
"properties": {
"hs_timestamp": "2021-11-12",
"hs_postal_mail_body": "Sent copy of contract to decision maker John",
"hubspot_owner_id": "9274996",
"hs_attachment_ids": "24332474034"
},
"associations": [
{
"to": {
"id": 501
},
"types": [
{
"associationCategory": "HUBSPOT_DEFINED",
"associationTypeId": 453
}
]
},
{
"to": {
"id": 502
},
"types": [
{
"associationCategory": "HUBSPOT_DEFINED",
"associationTypeId": 453
}
]
}
]
}

In the associations object, you should include the following:

The record you want to associate with the postal mail, specified by its unique
id
value.

The type of the association between the postal mail and the record. Include the

, or you can retrieve the value for custom association types (i.e. labels) via the
associations API
.
Retrieve postal mail engagements
You can retrieve postal mail engagements individually or in bulk.
To retrieve an individual postal mail engagement, make a
GET
request to
/crm/v3/objects/postal_mail/{postalMail}
. You can include the following parameters in the request:
Parameter
Description
properties
A comma separated list of the properties to be returned.
associations
A comma separated list of object types to retrieve associated IDs for. Any specified associations that don't exist will not be returned in the response. Learn more about the
associations API.
To retrieve a list of the postal mail engagements in your account, make a
GET
request to
crm/v3/objects/postal_mail
. You can include the following parameters in the request:
Parameter
Description

When you make a successful batch request, the response will include the ID of each postal mail engagement, which you can use to retrieve, update, and delete postal mail engagements.
Update postal mail engagements
You can update postal mail engagements individually or in batches. To update an individual engagement by its ID, make a
PATCH
request to
/crm/v3/objects/postal_mail/{postalMail}
.
In the request body, include the properties that you want to update. For example, to update the body of the engagement, your request body might look similar to the following:
Copy code snippet
//Example request body
{

"hs_postal_mail_body": "Sent copy of contract to decision maker John. Received  a call in response."
}
}

}
HubSpot will ignore values for read-only and non-existent properties. To clear a property value, pass an empty string for the property in the request body.

tab at the top of this article.
Associate existing postal mail with records
You can associate postal mail engagements with contact, company, deal, or ticket records. To associate postal mail with records, make a
PUT

.

contact
or
company
).
toObjectId

associations API
.
For example, your request URL might look similar to the following:
https://api.hubspot.com/crm/v3/objects/postal_mail/25727582880/associations/contact/104901/POSTAL_MAIL_TO_CONTACT
Remove an association

request to:
/crm/v3/objects/postal_mail/{postalMail}/associations/{toObjectType}/{toObjectId}/{associationTypeId}

on a record so it remains on the top of the record's timeline. The postal mail must already be associated with the record prior to pinning, and you an only pin one activity per record. To pin postal mail, include the postal mail's
id
in the
hs_pinned_engagement_id
field when creating or updating a record via the object APIs. Learn more about using the
companies,
contacts
,
deals
,
tickets
, and
custom objects
APIs.
Delete postal mail engagements

restore the engagement from the record timeline
.
To delete an individual postal mail engagement by its ID, make a
DELETE
request to
/crm/v3/objects/postal_mail/{postalMail}

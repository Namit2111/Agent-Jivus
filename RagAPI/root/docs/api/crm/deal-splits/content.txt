Deal splits
If your HubSpot account has a
Sales Hub
Enterprise
subscription, you can set up
deal splits
to split credit for deal amounts between multiple users. Once
deal splits are turned on
in your HubSpot account, you can use the deal splits API to create new deal splits or view and update existing splits.
Create or update deal splits
To add new splits or update existing splits for deals, make a
POST
request to
crm/v3/objects/deals/splits/batch/upsert
.
In your request, include the following fields for each deal:
Field
Description
id
The ID of the deal. You can retrieve this via the
deals API
.
splits
An array that contains the user to assign a split to, and the percentage of the deal amount to assign. In the array, include the following fields:
ownerId
: the
owner ID
assigned to the HubSpot user.
percentage
: the percentage of the deal amount to assign to the owner.
When adding deal splits, the deal's owner must be included as a split owner, the split percentages must add up to 1.0, and you must meet the limits for the split user maximum and split percentage minimum set in your
deal split settings.
If any deals included in the batch request fail validation for these requirements, the request will result in an error.
For example, to assign even deal credit to two users on a deal, your request would look like:
Copy code snippet
///Example request body
{
"inputs": [
{
"id": 5315919905,
"splits": [
{
"ownerId": 41629779,
"percentage": 0.5
},
{
"ownerId": 60158084,
"percentage": 0.5
}
]
}
]
}
1
///Example request body
2
{
3
"inputs"
: [
4
{
5
"id"
:
5315919905
,
6
"splits"
: [
7
{
8
"ownerId"
:
41629779
,
9
"percentage"
:
0.5
10
},
11
{
12
"ownerId"
:
60158084
,
13
"percentage"
:
0.5
14
}
15
]
16
}
17
]
18
}
If a deal didn't have existing splits, the splits will appear on the deal record following your request. If the deal had existing splits, they will be replaced by the splits you created in your request.
Retrieve deal splits
To view split information for deals, make a
POST
request to
crm/v3/objects/deals/splits/batch/read
. In your request, include the
id
values of the deals with splits you want to view. You can retrieve a deal's
id
via the
deals API
.
For example, to retrieve deal splits for two deals, your request could look like:
Copy code snippet
///Example request body
{
"inputs": [
{
"id": "5315919905"
},
{
"id": "17137567105"
}
]
}
xxxxxxxxxx

///Example request body
2
{
3
"inputs"
: [
4
{
5
"id"
:
"5315919905"
6
},
7
{
8
"id"
:
"17137567105"
9
}
10
]
11
}
For each deal, the response will include the date and time the splits were created or updated, the IDs of users splitting the deal, and the percentage of the deal amount assigned to each user.
For two deals, the response would look similar to:

Calling Extensions SDK
Calling SDK endpoint reference
Please note:
Our calling app partners no longer need to create and update call engagements manually; HubSpot will do it for them. Learn more
here
.
The
Calling Extensions SDK
allows apps to provide a custom calling option to HubSpot users directly from a record in the CRM.
A calling extension consists of three main components:
The
Calling Extensions SDK
, a JavaScript SDK that enables communication between your app and HubSpot.
The
calling settings endpoints
, which are used to set the calling settings for your app. Each HubSpot account that connects to your app will use these settings.
The
calling iframe
, which is where your app appears to HubSpot users and is configured using the calling settings endpoints.
For more information on the in-app calling experience, review
this knowledge base article
. Once your calling extension-enabled app is connected to HubSpot, it will appear as an option in the call switcher whenever a user
makes a call from HubSpot
.
If you don't have an app, you can
create one from your HubSpot developer account
. If you don't already have a HubSpot developer account, sign up for one
here
.
Please note:
only outgoing calls are currently supported.
Run the demo calling app
You have the option to test the Calling Extensions SDK on two different demo apps:
The
demo-minimal-js
features a minimal implementation of the SDK using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. View how the SDK is instantiated in
index.js
.
The
demo-react-ts
features a real-life implementation of the SDK using React, TypeScript, and Styled Components to act as a blueprint for your app. View how the SDK is instantiated in
useCti.ts
.
Please note:
these demo apps aren't fully functional calling apps and use mock data to provide a more realistic experience.
Install the demo calling app
You can run the demo apps with or without installation. To install the demo on your local environment:
Install
Node.js
on your environment.
Clone, fork, or
download the ZIP
of this repository.
Open your terminal, and navigate to the root directory of the project.
Run one of the following commands:
For the
demo-minimal-js
:
Copy code snippet
cd demos/demo-minimal-js && npm i && npm start
cd
demos/demo-minimal-js &&
npm
i &&
npm
start
For the
demo-react-ts
:
Copy code snippet
cd demos/demo-react-ts && npm i && npm start
xxxxxxxxxx
cd
demos/demo-react-ts &&
npm
i &&
npm
start
These will switch to the desired demo directory, install the
Node.js
dependencies required for the project using the
npm CLI
, and start the app.
Please note:
the
npm start
command will automatically open a new tab in your browser at
https://localhost:9025/
, and you may need to bypass a "Your connection is not secure" warning in order to access the application.
Launch the demo calling app from HubSpot
Navigate to your records:.
Contacts:
In your HubSpot account, navigate to
Contacts > Contacts
.
Company:
In your HubSpot account, navigate to
Contacts > Companies
.
Open your browser's developer console, and run the following command:
If you've completed the installation steps, for the
demo-minimal-js
or the
demo-react-ts
:
Copy code snippet
localStorage.setItem('LocalSettings:Calling:installDemoWidget', 'local');
xxxxxxxxxx
localStorage
.
setItem
(
'LocalSettings:Calling:installDemoWidget'
,
'local'
);
If you've skipped the installation steps:
For the
demo-minimal-js
:
Copy code snippet
localStorage.setItem('LocalSettings:Calling:installDemoWidget', 'app:js');
xxxxxxxxxx
localStorage
.
setItem
(
'LocalSettings:Calling:installDemoWidget'
,
'app:js'
);
For the
demo-react-ts
:
Copy code snippet
localStorage.setItem('LocalSettings:Calling:installDemoWidget', 'app');
xxxxxxxxxx
localStorage
.
setItem
(
'LocalSettings:Calling:installDemoWidget'
,
'app'
);
Refresh the page, and click the
Call
icon in the left sidebar. Click the
Call from
dropdown menu, and select the
name
of the demo app from step 2 (e.g. Demo App Local, Demo App JS, Demo App React).
Click
Call
to see how the demo app integrates with HubSpot via the Calling Extensions SDK. You can also see the events logged to your browser's developer console.
Install the Calling Extensions SDK on your calling app
To add the Calling Extensions SDK as a
Node.js
dependency to your calling app:
For npm, run:
Copy code snippet
npm i --save @hubspot/calling-extensions-sdk
xxxxxxxxxx
npm
i
--save
@hubspot/calling-extensions-sdk
For yarn, run:
Copy code snippet
yarn add @hubspot/calling-extensions-sdk
xxxxxxxxxx
yarn add @hubspot/calling-extensions-sdk
Using the Calling Extensions SDK
The Calling Extensions SDK exposes a simple API for HubSpot and a calling app to exchange messages. The messages are sent through methods exposed by the SDK and received through
eventHandlers
. You can find a full list of the available events in the
Events section
.
The following is a description of the events:
Dial number:
HubSpot sends the dial number event.
Outbound call started:
App notifies HubSpot when the call is started.
Create engagement:
HubSpot creates
a call engagement
with minimal information if requested by the app.
Engagement created:
HubSpot created an engagement.
EngagementId sent to App:
HubSpot sends the
engagementId
to the app.
Call ended:
App notifies when the call is ended.
Call completed:
App notifies when the user is done with the app user experience.
Update engagement:
App fetches the engagement by the
engagementId
, then merges and updates the engagement with additional call details. Learn more about
updating a call engagement via the API
or
via the SDK
.
To begin, create an instance of the
CallingExtensions
object. You can define the behavior of your extension by providing an option's object when you create your extensions instance. This option's object provides an
eventHandlers
field where you can specify the behavior of your extension. The following code block illustrates the available options and event handlers you can define:
Copy code snippet
import CallingExtensions from "@hubspot/calling-extensions-sdk";
const options = {
/** @property {boolean} debugMode - Whether to log various inbound/outbound debug messages to the console. If false, console.debug will be used instead of console.log */
debugMode: boolean,
// eventHandlers handle inbound messages
eventHandlers: {
onReady: () => {
/* HubSpot is ready to receive messages. */
},
onDialNumber: event => {
/* HubSpot sends a dial number from the contact */
},
onCreateEngagementSucceeded: event => {
/* HubSpot has created an engagement for this call. */
}
onEngagementCreatedFailed: event => {
/* HubSpot has failed to create an engagement for this call. */
}
onUpdateEngagementSucceeded: event => {
/* HubSpot has updated an engagement for this call. */
},
onUpdateEngagementFailed: event => {
/* HubSpot has failed to update an engagement for this call. */
}
onVisibilityChanged: event => {
/* Call widget's visibility is changed. */
}
}
};
const extensions = new CallingExtensions(options);

Using the calling settings endpoint
Using your API tool (e.g. Postman), send the following payload to HubSpot's settings API. Ensure you get the APP_ID of your calling app and your app
DEVELOPER_ACCOUNT_API_KEY
.
Please note:
the
isReady
flag indicates whether the app is ready for production. This flag should be set to false during testing.

Calling SDK | Frequently Asked Questions
How is user authentication handled?
The calling app should handle authentication.
Is Calling Extensions hosted on a CDN?
Yes. You can install the Calling Extensions SDK via
jsDeliver
. For example, to install calling-extensions-sdk@0.2.2, you can use
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@hubspot/calling-extensions-sdk@0.2.2/dist/main.js
.
When should an engagement be created versus updated?
A user can initiate a call from inside the HubSpot UI and outside the HubSpot UI (e.g. mobile app, redirected number, etc.) If a call is initiated from within HubSpot UI, HubSpot will create a call engagement and send the engagement to the calling app. Once the call finishes, the call app can update this engagement with additional call details. If a call is initiated outside of HubSpot UI, the app should create the call engagement.
What scopes are required as a part of the integration?
Add contacts and timeline scopes are required. These scopes ensure your application has access to contacts and the ability to create and update call engagements in the CRM.
Can this functionality be added to an already existing application in the marketplace or do I create a new app?
If you already have an existing app that serves the calling use case then you can directly add this functionality to your existing app. All customers who already have your app installed will get access to this new functionality without having to install the app again.
Can I integrate my existing soft phone application in the SDK?
Yes, integrating your existing soft phone application should be very easy. Just follow the steps in the documentation above to have your application up and running.
Can users use multiple integrations at the same time?
Yes, users can use multiple third-party calling integrations at the same time. They can use the provider switcher presented after clicking on the call button to seamlessly switch between providers.
Can free users install app integrations?
Yes, all users can install the app.
If a user already has my app installed, does the integration automatically show up?
Yes, if a user already has installed your app, and you are updating the same app with the calling extensions, the integration will automatically show up. Currently, there is no way for the developer to enable the calling app only to a subset of customers.
Can any user install or uninstall an app?
No, only users who have necessary permissions can install and uninstall an app. Learn more about how to
review a user's permissions
.
Can I create a custom calling property?
Yes, you can create a custom calling property using the
properties API
.
Can I place a call from a custom object?
Yes, calling integrations can place calls from custom objects as long as they only use the SDK to create the call. Each integration will need to verify that they only use the Calling SDK to create calls and to notify HubSpot in the
outgoingCall
event.
First, verify that the integration is using the Calling SDK to create engagements in the outgoingCall event:
Copy code snippet
outgoingCall({ createEngagement: true });
xxxxxxxxxx
outgoingCall
({
createEngagement
:
true
});
If
createEngagement
is true, learn how to update your app information
here
.
Here is the example for the entire
outgoingCall
event:
Copy code snippet
const callInfo = {
phoneNumber: string, // optional unless call is initiated by the widget
createEngagement: true // whether HubSpot should create an engagement for this call
callStartTime: number // optional unless call is initiated by the widget
};
extensions.outgoingCall(callInfo);

// whether HubSpot should create an engagement for this call

// optional unless call is initiated by the widget

};

outgoingCall
(
callInfo
);

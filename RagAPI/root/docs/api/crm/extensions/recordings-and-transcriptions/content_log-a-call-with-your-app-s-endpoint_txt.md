# HubSpot Calling Extension: Recordings and Transcriptions

This document details how to integrate call recording and transcription functionality into your HubSpot app.  This involves creating an endpoint to serve authenticated recording URLs, registering that endpoint with HubSpot, logging calls using the engagements API, and finally, marking recordings as ready for transcription.

## Requirements

* **HubSpot Seat:**  Users associated with calls must have a paid Sales or Services hub seat.
* **Audio File Format:** Only .WAV, .FLAC, and .MP4 audio files are supported.
* **Downloadable Audio:** The audio file must be downloadable as an octet-stream.
* **Multi-Channel Audio:** Each speaker should be on a separate audio channel. For two-channel calls, the caller should be on channel 1, and the recipient on channel 2.
* **Range Header Support:** The recording URL must respect the `Range` header and return a `206 Partial Content` response (not a `200 OK`) to enable fast forward/rewind functionality in the HubSpot app.


## 1. Create an Endpoint for Authenticated Recording URLs

Create an endpoint that retrieves authenticated call URLs. This endpoint will be called by HubSpot to access recordings.

**Endpoint Parameters:**

* `externalId` (path parameter): Unique ID of the call URL.  Matches the `hs_call_external_id` in the engagements API call.
* `externalAccountId` (query parameter): Unique ID of the HubSpot account that made the call.
* `appId` (query parameter): ID of your HubSpot app.

**Example Endpoint:**  `https://your-app.com/retrieve/authenticated/recordings/%s`  (The `%s` will be replaced by HubSpot with the `externalId`)

**Response (JSON):**

```json
{
  "authenticatedUrl": "https://your-app.com/retrieve/authenticated/recordings/test-call-01"
}
```


## 2. Register Your Endpoint with HubSpot (Calling Settings API)

Register your endpoint using the HubSpot Calling Settings API.

**API Call:** `POST /crm/v3/extensions/calling/{appId}/settings/recording`

**Request Body (JSON):**

```json
{
  "urlToRetrieveAuthedRecording": "https://your-app.com/retrieve/authenticated/recordings/%s"
}
```

**PATCH Request for Updates:** Use a `PATCH` request to the same endpoint to update the `urlToRetrieveAuthedRecording` if your endpoint URL changes.


## 3. Log a Call using the Engagements API

Log call details using the HubSpot Engagements API.  Include the necessary properties to link the call to your recording.

**API Call:** `POST /crm/v3/objects/calls`

**Request Body (JSON):**

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "hs_timestamp": "2021-03-17T01:32:44.872Z",
    "hs_call_title": "Call Title",
    "hubspot_owner_id": "1234567", // HubSpot User ID
    "hs_call_body": "Call Summary",
    "hs_call_duration": "3800", // Duration in milliseconds
    "hs_call_from_number": "+15551234567",
    "hs_call_to_number": "+15559876543",
    "hs_call_source": "INTEGRATIONS_PLATFORM", // Required
    "hs_call_status": "COMPLETED",
    "hs_call_app_id": "your-app-id",
    "hs_call_external_id": "test-call-01",
    "hs_call_external_account_id": "your-account-id"
  }
}
```

**Association with a Record:** After creating the call object, associate it with a record (e.g., contact) using a `PUT` request to:

`/crm/v3/objects/calls/{callId}/associations/{toObjectType}/{toObjectId}/{associationType}`


## 4. Mark a Call Recording as Ready

Notify HubSpot that the recording is ready for transcription.

**API Call:** `POST /crm/v3/extensions/calling/recordings/ready`

**Request Body (JSON):**

```json
{
  "engagementId": 17591596434 // Call ID from step 3
}
```

## Important Note:

The legacy unauthenticated approach for logging call recordings will be deprecated.  Migrate to the authenticated approach before September 2024.

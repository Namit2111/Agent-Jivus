# HubSpot Calling Extensions: Recordings and Transcriptions

This document details how to integrate call recording and transcription functionality into your HubSpot app.  This requires using several HubSpot APIs and creating a custom endpoint to serve authenticated recording URLs.

## Requirements

* **HubSpot Seat:** Users associated with calls must have paid Sales or Services hub seats.
* **Audio File Format:** Only .WAV, .FLAC, and .MP4 audio files are supported for transcription.
* **Octet-Stream Download:** The audio file must be downloadable as an octet-stream.
* **Audio Channels:** Each speaker should be on a separate audio channel. For two-channel calls, the caller should be on channel 1, and the recipient on channel 2.
* **`Range` Header Support:** The recording URL must respect the `Range` header and return a `206 Partial Content` status code for fast-forward/rewind functionality.


## 1. Create an Endpoint for Authenticated Recording URLs

Create an endpoint that retrieves authenticated call recording URLs. This endpoint will be called by HubSpot.

**Endpoint Parameters:**

* **`externalId` (path parameter):** Unique ID of the call recording.  This should match the `hs_call_external_id` in the engagements API call.
* **`externalAccountId` (query parameter):** Unique ID of the HubSpot account.  This should match the `hs_call_external_account_id` in the engagements API call.
* **`appId` (query parameter):** Your app's ID.

**Endpoint Response (JSON):**

```json
{
  "authenticatedUrl": "https://app-test.com/retrieve/authenticated/recordings/test-call-01"
}
```


## 2. Register Your Endpoint with HubSpot (Calling Settings API)

Register your endpoint using the HubSpot Calling Settings API.

**API Endpoint:** `/crm/v3/extensions/calling/{appId}/settings/recording`

**HTTP Method:** `POST` (for initial registration), `PATCH` (for updating)

**Request Body (JSON):**

```json
{
  "urlToRetrieveAuthedRecording": "https://app-test.com/retrieve/authenticated/recordings/%s"
}
```

**`%s` Placeholder:**  HubSpot replaces `%s` with the `externalId` when calling your endpoint.


## 3. Log a Call with Your App's Endpoint (Engagements API)

Log the call using the HubSpot Engagements API.  Include necessary properties to link the call to your recording.

**API Endpoint:** `/crm/v3/objects/calls`

**HTTP Method:** `POST`

**Request Body (JSON):**

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "hs_timestamp": "2021-03-17T01:32:44.872Z",
    "hs_call_title": "Test v3 API",
    "hubspot_owner_id": "11526487",
    "hs_call_body": "Decision maker out, will call back tomorrow",
    "hs_call_duration": "3800",
    "hs_call_from_number": "(555) 555 5555",
    "hs_call_to_number": "(555) 555 5555",
    "hs_call_source": "INTEGRATIONS_PLATFORM",
    "hs_call_status": "COMPLETED",
    "hs_call_app_id": "test-app-01",
    "hs_call_external_id": "test-call-01",
    "hs_call_external_account_id": "test-account-01"
  }
}
```

**Association with a Record:** After creating the call object, associate it with a record type (e.g., contact) using the associations API: `/crm/v3/objects/calls/{callId}/associations/{toObjectType}/{toObjectId}/{associationType}`.  This ensures the transcript appears on the record timeline.


## 4. Mark Call Recording as Ready

Notify HubSpot that the recording is ready for transcription.

**API Endpoint:** `/crm/v3/extensions/calling/recordings/ready`

**HTTP Method:** `POST`

**Request Body (JSON):**

```json
{
  "engagementId": 17591596434
}
```

## Important Note:

The unauthenticated approach for logging call recordings will be deprecated after September 2024.  Update to the authenticated approach described above before then.

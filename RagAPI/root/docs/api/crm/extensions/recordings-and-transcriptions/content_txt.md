# HubSpot Call Recordings and Transcriptions Integration

This document details how to integrate your application with HubSpot to handle call recordings and transcriptions.  This involves creating an endpoint to serve authenticated recording URLs, registering that endpoint with HubSpot, logging calls using the HubSpot API, and finally marking recordings as ready for transcription.

## Requirements

* **HubSpot Sales or Services Hub Seat:**  Users associated with the calls must have a paid Sales or Services Hub seat.
* **Supported Audio Formats:** Only `.WAV`, `.FLAC`, and `.MP4` audio files are supported.
* **Octet-Stream Download:** The audio file must be downloadable as an `octet-stream`.
* **Multi-Channel Audio:** Each speaker should be on a separate audio channel. For two-channel calls, the caller should be on channel 1, and the recipient on channel 2, regardless of call direction.
* **Range Header Support:** The recording URL must respect the `Range` header and return a `206 Partial Content` status code for fast-forward/rewind functionality.

## 1. Create an Endpoint for Authenticated Recording URLs

Create an endpoint that retrieves authenticated call recording URLs.  This endpoint will be called by HubSpot to access recordings.

**Endpoint Parameters:**

* `externalId` (path parameter): Unique ID of the call (used in the engagements API).
* `externalAccountId` (query parameter): Unique ID of the HubSpot account.
* `appId` (query parameter): Your app's ID.

**Endpoint Response (JSON):**

```json
{
  "authenticatedUrl": "https://app-test.com/retrieve/authenticated/recordings/test-call-01"
}
```

**Example Implementation (Conceptual):**

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/retrieve/authenticated/recordings/<externalId>')
def get_recording_url(externalId):
  externalAccountId = request.args.get('externalAccountId')
  appId = request.args.get('appId')
  # ... Your logic to retrieve the authenticated URL based on parameters ...
  authenticated_url = f"https://your-storage/{externalId}.wav" # Replace with your actual URL generation logic.
  return jsonify({"authenticatedUrl": authenticated_url})

if __name__ == '__main__':
  app.run(debug=True)
```


## 2. Register Your Endpoint with HubSpot (Calling Settings API)

Register your endpoint with HubSpot using the Calling Settings API.

**API Call:** `POST /crm/v3/extensions/calling/{appId}/settings/recording`

**Request Body (JSON):**

```json
{
  "urlToRetrieveAuthedRecording": "https://app-test.com/retrieve/authenticated/recordings/%s"
}
```

* Replace `{appId}` with your app's ID.
* The `%s` placeholder will be replaced by HubSpot with the `externalId`.


**Example using Python's `requests` library:**

```python
import requests

appId = "YOUR_APP_ID"
endpoint_url = "https://app-test.com/retrieve/authenticated/recordings/%s"
url = f"https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/extensions/calling/{appId}/settings/recording"
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" #replace with your api key
}
data = {"urlToRetrieveAuthedRecording": endpoint_url}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
print(response.status_code)
print(response.json())

```

Use `PATCH` to update the endpoint URL if necessary.


## 3. Log a Call with Your App's Endpoint (Engagements API)

Log a call using the Engagements API, including necessary properties.

**API Call:** `POST /crm/v3/objects/calls`

**Request Body (JSON):**

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "hs_timestamp": "2024-10-27T12:00:00Z",
    "hs_call_title": "Call Title",
    "hubspot_owner_id": "YOUR_USER_ID",
    "hs_call_body": "Call Summary",
    "hs_call_duration": "300",  // Duration in seconds
    "hs_call_from_number": "+15551234567",
    "hs_call_to_number": "+15559876543",
    "hs_call_source": "INTEGRATIONS_PLATFORM",
    "hs_call_status": "COMPLETED",
    "hs_call_app_id": "YOUR_APP_ID",
    "hs_call_external_id": "unique-call-id-123",
    "hs_call_external_account_id": "your-account-id"
  }
}
```

Remember to associate the call with a record (e.g., contact) using the Associations API.


## 4. Mark a Call Recording as Ready

Once the recording is available, notify HubSpot that it's ready for transcription.

**API Call:** `POST /crm/v3/extensions/calling/recordings/ready`

**Request Body (JSON):**

```json
{
  "engagementId": "YOUR_ENGAGEMENT_ID" //the id returned from the call logging api call
}
```


This comprehensive guide provides a complete workflow for integrating call recordings and transcriptions with HubSpot. Remember to replace placeholders like `{appId}`, `YOUR_API_KEY`, `YOUR_USER_ID`, etc., with your actual values.  Always consult the official HubSpot API documentation for the most up-to-date information and details.

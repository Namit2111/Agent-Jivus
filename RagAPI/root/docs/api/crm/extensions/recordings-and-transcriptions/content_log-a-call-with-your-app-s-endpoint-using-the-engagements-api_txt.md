# HubSpot Calling Extensions: Recordings and Transcriptions

This document details how to integrate call recording and transcription functionality into your HubSpot application.  This involves creating an endpoint to serve authenticated recording URLs, registering that endpoint with HubSpot, logging calls using the HubSpot API, and finally marking recordings as ready for transcription.

## Requirements

* **HubSpot Seat:** Users associated with calls must have paid Sales or Services hub seats.
* **Audio File Format:** Only .WAV, .FLAC, and .MP4 audio files are supported.
* **Downloadable Audio:** The audio file must be downloadable as an octet-stream.
* **Multi-Channel Audio:** Each speaker should be on a separate audio channel. For two-channel calls, the caller should be on channel 1, and the recipient on channel 2.
* **Range Header Support:** The recording URL must respect the `Range` header and return a `206 Partial Content` status code for seeking functionality within the HubSpot application.


## 1. Create an Endpoint for Authenticated Recording URLs

Create an endpoint that retrieves authenticated call recording URLs. This endpoint will be called by HubSpot to access recordings.

**Request:** `GET` request to your app's endpoint

**Parameters:**

* `externalId` (path parameter): Unique ID of the call recording.  This should match the `hs_call_external_id` in the engagements API call.
* `externalAccountId` (query parameter): Unique ID of the HubSpot account. This should match the `hs_call_external_account_id` in the engagements API call.
* `appId` (query parameter): Your app's ID.

**Response:**  JSON response containing the authenticated URL.

```json
{
  "authenticatedUrl": "https://app-test.com/retrieve/authenticated/recordings/test-call-01"
}
```


## 2. Register Your Endpoint with HubSpot

Register your endpoint using the HubSpot Calling Settings API.

**Request:** `POST` to `/crm/v3/extensions/calling/{appId}/settings/recording`

**Body:**

```json
{
  "urlToRetrieveAuthedRecording": "https://app-test.com/retrieve/authenticated/recordings/%s"
}
```

* Replace `{appId}` with your app's ID.
* The `%s` placeholder will be replaced by HubSpot with the `externalId` of the engagement.  Ensure the full path, including `https://`, is provided.

**Update Endpoint:** Use a `PATCH` request to the same endpoint to update the URL if needed.


## 3. Log a Call with the Engagements API

Log a call using the HubSpot Engagements API, including the necessary properties to link it to your recording.

**Request:** `POST` to `/crm/v3/objects/calls`

**Body:**

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "hs_timestamp": "2021-03-17T01:32:44.872Z",
    "hs_call_title": "Test v3 API",
    "hubspot_owner_id": "11526487",  // HubSpot user ID
    "hs_call_body": "Decision maker out, will call back tomorrow",
    "hs_call_duration": "3800", // Duration in milliseconds
    "hs_call_from_number": "(555) 555 5555",
    "hs_call_to_number": "(555) 555 5555",
    "hs_call_source": "INTEGRATIONS_PLATFORM",
    "hs_call_status": "COMPLETED",
    "hs_call_app_id": "test-app-01", // Your app ID
    "hs_call_external_id": "test-call-01", // Unique ID for the call
    "hs_call_external_account_id": "test-account-01" // Your account ID
  }
}
```

**Association with Records:**  After creating the call object, associate it with the relevant record type (e.g., contact) using a `PUT` request to `/crm/v3/objects/calls/{callId}/associations/{toObjectType}/{toObjectId}/{associationType}`.


## 4. Mark a Call Recording as Ready

Notify HubSpot that the recording is ready for transcription.

**Request:** `POST` to `/crm/v3/extensions/calling/recordings/ready`

**Body:**

```json
{
  "engagementId": 17591596434 // Call ID from step 3.
}
```


## Important Note:

The unauthenticated approach to logging call recordings will be deprecated after September 2024. Migrate to the authenticated approach outlined above before then.

# HubSpot Calling Extensions: Recordings and Transcriptions

This document details how to integrate call recording and transcription functionality into your HubSpot application.  This requires creating an endpoint to serve authenticated recording URLs, registering that endpoint with HubSpot, and logging calls using the HubSpot API.

## Requirements

* **HubSpot Seat:** Users associated with the calls must have paid Sales or Service Hub seats.
* **Audio File Format:** Only .WAV, .FLAC, and .MP4 audio files are supported.
* **Downloadable Audio:** The audio file must be downloadable as an octet-stream.
* **Audio Channels:** Each speaker should be on a separate audio channel. For two-channel calls, the caller should be on channel 1, and the recipient on channel 2.
* **Range Header Support:** To enable fast forwarding and rewinding, the recording URL must support the `Range` header and return a `206 Partial Content` response.

## 1. Create an Endpoint for Authenticated Recording URLs

Create an endpoint that retrieves authenticated call URLs. This endpoint will be called by HubSpot to access recordings.

**Request:** `GET` request to your app's endpoint.

**Parameters:**

* `externalId` (path parameter): Unique ID of the call URL.  Matches the `hs_call_external_id` in the engagements API call.
* `externalAccountId` (query parameter): Unique ID of the HubSpot account. Matches the `hs_call_external_account_id` in the engagements API call.
* `appId` (query parameter): Your app's ID.

**Response:** JSON response containing the authenticated URL.

```json
{
  "authenticatedUrl": "https://app-test.com/retrieve/authenticated/recordings/test-call-01"
}
```

## 2. Register Your Endpoint with HubSpot

Register your endpoint using the HubSpot Calling Settings API.

**Request:** `POST` request to `/crm/v3/extensions/calling/{appId}/settings/recording`

**Body:**

```json
{
  "urlToRetrieveAuthedRecording": "https://app-test.com/retrieve/authenticated/recordings/%s"
}
```

* Replace `{appId}` with your app's ID.
* The `%s` placeholder will be replaced by HubSpot with the `externalId` when calling your endpoint.

**Update Endpoint:** Use a `PATCH` request to the same endpoint to update the URL if necessary.

## 3. Log a Call Using the Engagements API

Log calls using the HubSpot Engagements API. Include necessary properties to link the call to your recording endpoint.

**Request:** `POST` request to `/crm/v3/objects/calls`

**Body:**

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "hs_timestamp": "2021-03-17T01:32:44.872Z",
    "hs_call_title": "Test v3 API",
    "hubspot_owner_id": "11526487",
    "hs_call_body": "Decision maker out, will call back tomorrow",
    "hs_call_duration": "3800",
    "hs_call_from_number": "(555) 555 5555",
    "hs_call_to_number": "(555) 555 5555",
    "hs_call_source": "INTEGRATIONS_PLATFORM",
    "hs_call_status": "COMPLETED",
    "hs_call_app_id": "test-app-01",
    "hs_call_external_id": "test-call-01",
    "hs_call_external_account_id": "test-account-01"
  }
}
```

*  `hs_call_external_id`, `hs_call_external_account_id`, `hs_call_app_id`, and `hs_call_source` are required.
* Associate the call with a record type using a `PUT` request to `/crm/v3/objects/calls/{callId}/associations/{toObjectType}/{toObjectId}/{associationType}`.

## 4. Mark a Call Recording as Ready

Notify HubSpot when a recording is ready for transcription.

**Request:** `POST` request to `/crm/v3/extensions/calling/recordings/ready`

**Body:**

```json
{
  "engagementId": 17591596434
}
```

Replace `17591596434` with the `engagementId` of the call.


## Legacy Approach Deprecation

The legacy unauthenticated approach for logging call recordings will be deprecated after September 2024.  Migrate to the authenticated approach described above before that date.

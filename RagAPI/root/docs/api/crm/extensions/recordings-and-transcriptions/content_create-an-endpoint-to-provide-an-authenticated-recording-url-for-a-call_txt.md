# HubSpot Calling Extension: Recordings and Transcriptions

This document details how to integrate call recording and transcription functionality into your HubSpot app.  This involves creating an endpoint to serve authenticated recording URLs, registering that endpoint with HubSpot, logging calls using the engagements API, and finally marking recordings as ready for transcription.

## Requirements

* **HubSpot Seat:** Users associated with calls must have paid Sales or Services Hub seats.
* **Audio File Format:** Only .WAV, .FLAC, and .MP4 audio files are supported.
* **Downloadable Audio:** The audio file must be downloadable as an octet-stream.
* **Multi-Channel Audio:** Each speaker should be on a separate audio channel. For two-speaker calls, the caller should be on channel 1, and the recipient on channel 2.
* **Range Header Support:** The recording URL must support the `Range` header and return a `206 Partial Content` response for partial content requests (not a `200` response).


## 1. Create an Endpoint for Authenticated Recording URLs

Create an endpoint that retrieves authenticated call URLs. This endpoint will be called by HubSpot to access recordings.

**Request:** `GET` request to your app's endpoint.

**Parameters:**

* `externalId` (path parameter): Unique ID of the call URL.  This should match the `hs_call_external_id` in the engagements API call.
* `externalAccountId` (query parameter): Unique ID of the HubSpot account.
* `appId` (query parameter): Your app's ID.

**Response:** JSON response containing the authenticated URL.

```json
{
  "authenticatedUrl": "https://app-test.com/retrieve/authenticated/recordings/test-call-01"
}
```

## 2. Register your Endpoint with HubSpot (Calling Settings API)

Register your endpoint using the HubSpot Calling Settings API.

**Request:** `POST` to `/crm/v3/extensions/calling/{appId}/settings/recording`

**Body:**

```json
{
  "urlToRetrieveAuthedRecording": "https://app-test.com/retrieve/authenticated/recordings/%s"
}
```

* Replace `{appId}` with your app's ID.
* `%s` is a placeholder that HubSpot will replace with the `externalId` when calling your endpoint.

**Updating the Endpoint:** Use a `PATCH` request to the same endpoint to update the `urlToRetrieveAuthedRecording` if your endpoint URL changes.

## 3. Log a Call with the Engagements API

Log the call using the HubSpot Engagements API.  Include necessary properties to associate the call with your recording.

**Request:** `POST` to `/crm/v3/objects/calls`

**Body:**

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "hs_timestamp": "2021-03-17T01:32:44.872Z",
    "hs_call_title": "Test v3 API",
    "hubspot_owner_id": "11526487", // HubSpot User ID
    "hs_call_body": "Decision maker out, will call back tomorrow",
    "hs_call_duration": "3800", // Duration in milliseconds
    "hs_call_from_number": "(555) 555 5555",
    "hs_call_to_number": "(555) 555 5555",
    "hs_call_source": "INTEGRATIONS_PLATFORM",
    "hs_call_status": "COMPLETED",
    "hs_call_app_id": "test-app-01", // Your app's ID
    "hs_call_external_id": "test-call-01", // Must match externalId in step 1
    "hs_call_external_account_id": "test-account-01" // Your account ID
  }
}
```

**Association with a Record:** After creating the call object, associate it with a record type (e.g., contact) using a `PUT` request to `/crm/v3/objects/calls/{callId}/associations/{toObjectType}/{toObjectId}/{associationType}`.


## 4. Mark a Call Recording as Ready

Once the recording is available, notify HubSpot that it's ready for transcription.

**Request:** `POST` to `/crm/v3/extensions/calling/recordings/ready`

**Body:**

```json
{
  "engagementId": 17591596434 // Call ID from step 3
}
```

## Important Note

The unauthenticated approach for logging call recordings will be deprecated after September 2024.  Migrate to the authenticated approach described above before then.

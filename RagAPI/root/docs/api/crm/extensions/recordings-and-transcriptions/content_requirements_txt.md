# HubSpot Calling Extension: Recordings and Transcriptions

This document details how to integrate call recording and transcription functionality into your HubSpot app.  This involves creating an endpoint to serve authenticated recording URLs, registering that endpoint with HubSpot, logging calls via the HubSpot API, and marking recordings as ready for transcription.

**Requirements:**

* HubSpot users must have a paid Sales or Service hub seat.
* Only `.WAV`, `.FLAC`, and `.MP4` audio files are supported.
* Audio files must be downloadable as an octet-stream.
* Each speaker should be on a separate audio channel (for two-channel calls, caller on channel 1, recipient on channel 2).
* The recording URL endpoint must support the `Range` header and return a `206 Partial Content` status code for seeking functionality within the HubSpot app.

## 1. Create an Endpoint for Authenticated Recording URLs

Create an endpoint that retrieves authenticated call recording URLs.  This endpoint will be called by HubSpot.

**Request:**

* **Method:** `GET`
* **URL:**  `your-app-endpoint/{externalId}?externalAccountId={externalAccountId}&appId={appId}`
* **Parameters:**
    * `externalId`: (path parameter) Unique ID of the call recording.  Matches the `hs_call_external_id` property in the engagements API call.
    * `externalAccountId`: (query parameter) Unique ID of the HubSpot account. Matches the `hs_call_external_account_id` property in the engagements API call.
    * `appId`: (query parameter) Your app's ID.

**Response:**

* **Status Code:** `200 OK`
* **Body:** JSON object with the `authenticatedUrl` field.

```json
{
  "authenticatedUrl": "https://your-app-domain/retrieve/authenticated/recordings/test-call-01"
}
```

## 2. Register Your Endpoint with HubSpot (Calling Settings API)

Register your endpoint with HubSpot using the Calling Settings API.

**Request:**

* **Method:** `POST` (or `PATCH` to update)
* **URL:** `/crm/v3/extensions/calling/{appId}/settings/recording`
* **Body:** JSON object with the `urlToRetrieveAuthedRecording` field.  Use `%s` as a placeholder for the `externalId`.

```json
{
  "urlToRetrieveAuthedRecording": "https://your-app-domain/retrieve/authenticated/recordings/%s"
}
```

Replace `{appId}` with your app's ID.


## 3. Log a Call with the Engagements API

Log a call using the HubSpot Engagements API.  Include necessary properties to associate the call with your recording.

**Request:**

* **Method:** `POST`
* **URL:** `/crm/v3/objects/calls`
* **Body:** JSON object with the `properties` field.  The following properties are required:

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "hs_timestamp": "2024-10-27T12:00:00Z", // ISO 8601 format
    "hs_call_title": "Call Title",
    "hubspot_owner_id": "1234567", // HubSpot user ID
    "hs_call_body": "Call summary",
    "hs_call_duration": "300", // Duration in seconds
    "hs_call_from_number": "+15551234567",
    "hs_call_to_number": "+15557654321",
    "hs_call_source": "INTEGRATIONS_PLATFORM", // Required
    "hs_call_status": "COMPLETED", // or other appropriate status
    "hs_call_app_id": "your-app-id", // Your app's ID
    "hs_call_external_id": "test-call-02", // Unique external ID
    "hs_call_external_account_id": "your-account-id" // Unique external account ID
  }
}
```

You'll also need to associate the call with a record (e.g., contact) using the Associations API: `PUT /crm/v3/objects/calls/{callId}/associations/{toObjectType}/{toObjectId}/{associationType}`.


## 4. Mark a Call Recording as Ready

Notify HubSpot that the recording is ready for transcription.

**Request:**

* **Method:** `POST`
* **URL:** `/crm/v3/extensions/calling/recordings/ready`
* **Body:** JSON object with the `engagementId` (HubSpot ID of the call object created in step 3).

```json
{
  "engagementId": 1234567890
}
```

**Note:** The legacy unauthenticated approach will be deprecated after September 2024.  Migrate to the authenticated approach outlined above.

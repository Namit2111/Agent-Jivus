Extending the CRM | Recordings and transcriptions
Recordings and transcripts
If you want to make call recordings playable in your HubSpot account, or you want to build on top of HubSpot's
Conversation Intelligence
functionality, you can use the endpoints to automatically transcribe calls and log them within HubSpot.
Requirements
HubSpot will only transcribe calls associated with
users with a paid
Sales
or
Services
hub seat
.
Only .WAV, .FLAC, and .MP4 audio files will be transcribed.
The audio file must be downloadable as an octet-stream.
In the transcription system, HubSpot splits the audio file into its different channels and treats each channel as a separate speaker. If all of the speakers are on the same audio channel, or if the caller or recipient are on an unexpected channel, HubSpot will
not
be able to transcribe the audio recording. Therefore, each speaker in an audio file should be on a separate channel. For calls with two channels, the caller should be on channel 1, and the call recipient should be on channel 2, regardless of whether the call is inbound or outbound.
If your users want to fast forward or rewind a call recording in the HubSpot app, the recording URL needs to respect the
range
header and return a
206 partial content
​(not a
200
server code).
Create an endpoint to provide an authenticated recording URL for a call
To list and transcribe calls on a
record's timeline
in HubSpot, create an endpoint that will be invoked to retrieve the authenticated call URLs associated with each engagement.
Your endpoint should accept the following parameters:
externalId:
the unique ID associated with a call URL, provided as a path parameter. This will correspond to the same parameter you include in the metadata of your
POST
request to the engagements API, which you can then use in your app's backend to associate with the recording URL.
externalAccountId:
a unique ID associated with the HubSpot account that made the call engagement, provided as a query parameter. You can use this parameter along with the externalId to identify the call recording.
appId:
the
ID of your app
, provided as a query parameter.
Your endpoint should return a JSON response with a
authenticatedUrl
field that provides the recording URL.
Copy code snippet
// Response to GET request to your app's endpoint
{
"authenticatedUrl": "https://app-test.com/retrieve/authenticated/recordings/test-call-01"
}
1
// Response to GET request to your app's endpoint
2
{
3
"authenticatedUrl"
:
"https://app-test.com/retrieve/authenticated/recordings/test-call-01"
4
}
Register your app's endpoint with HubSpot using the calling settings API
Once your endpoint is ready, make a
POST
request using your app's ID to
/crm/v3/extensions/calling/{appId}/settings/recording
and provide the URL of your endpoint with the
urlToRetrieveAuthedRecording
parameter in the body of your request.
Your endpoint's URL must contain the
%s
character sequence, which HubSpot will substitute with the
externalId
of the engagement when calling your endpoint. The
%s
character sequence can be located anywhere in your URL.
Provide the full path of your endpoint URL in your
POST
request, including the
https://
prefix.
For example:
Copy code snippet
// Example POST request to configure your app's endpoint
{
"urlToRetrieveAuthedRecording": "https://app-test.com/retrieve/authenticated/recordings/%s"
}
xxxxxxxxxx
4
1
// Example POST request to configure your app's endpoint
2
{
3
"urlToRetrieveAuthedRecording"
:
"https://app-test.com/retrieve/authenticated/recordings/%s"
4
}
If you change the location of your endpoint, you can make a
PATCH
request to the same HubSpot endpoint above and provide an updated value for
urlToRetrieveAuthedRecording
.
Log a call with your app's endpoint using the engagements API
After you've registered your calling app's endpoint with HubSpot, you can log a call by making a
POST
request to the
/crm/v3/objects/calls
endpoint
, and including the engagement data within the properties field in the body of your request.
The
hs_call_external_id
,
hs_call_external_account_id
,
hs_call_app_id
, and
hs_call_source
properties are required to ensure that HubSpot can fetch the authenticated recording URL.
The body of an example request is shown below:
Copy code snippet
// POST request to https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/calls
{
"properties": {
"hs_timestamp": "2021-03-17T01:32:44.872Z",
"hs_call_title": "Test v3 API",
"hubspot_owner_id": "11526487",
"hs_call_body": "Decision maker out, will call back tomorrow",
"hs_call_duration": "3800",
"hs_call_from_number": "(555) 555 5555",
"hs_call_to_number": "(555) 555 5555",
"hs_call_source": "INTEGRATIONS_PLATFORM", // this has to be INTEGRATIONS_PLATFORM
"hs_call_status": "COMPLETED",
"hs_call_app_id": "test-app-01",
"hs_call_external_id": "test-call-01",
"hs_call_external_account_id": "test-account-01"
}
}
xxxxxxxxxx
17
1
// POST request to https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/calls
2
{
3
"properties"
: {
4
"hs_timestamp"
:
"2021-03-17T01:32:44.872Z"
,
5
"hs_call_title"
:
"Test v3 API"
,
6
"hubspot_owner_id"
:
"11526487"
,
7
"hs_call_body"
:
"Decision maker out, will call back tomorrow"
,
8
"hs_call_duration"
:
"3800"
,
9
"hs_call_from_number"
:
"(555) 555 5555"
,
10
"hs_call_to_number"
:
"(555) 555 5555"
,
11
"hs_call_source"
:
"INTEGRATIONS_PLATFORM"
,
// this has to be INTEGRATIONS_PLATFORM
12
"hs_call_status"
:
"COMPLETED"
,
13
"hs_call_app_id"
:
"test-app-01"
,
14
"hs_call_external_id"
:
"test-call-01"
,
15
"hs_call_external_account_id"
:
"test-account-01"
16
}
17
}
Next, you'll need to
associate the call with a record type
to ensure the transcript appears on the record timeline.
To make this association, make a
PUT
request to
/crm/v3/objects/calls/{callId}/associations/{toObjectType}/{toObjectId}/{associationType}
.
For example, if the ID of the logged call you created above is
17591596434
, the ID of the contact you wanted to associate it with is
104901
, and the ID of the associationType is
194
, your request URL would be:
https://api.hubspot.com/crm/v3/objects/calls/17591596434/associations/contacts/104901/194
When one of your app's users navigates to the associated record timeline to view the engagement, HubSpot will call the endpoint you configured to serve the authenticated recording URL. For example, to retrieve the recording URL associated with the example engagement above, HubSpot would make a
GET
request to:
https://app-test.com/retrieve/authenticated/recordings/test-call-01?appId=app-101&externalAccountId=test-account-01
Mark a call recording as ready
Create the call object as shown
above
, and then do the following:
Make a
POST
request to
/crm/v3/extensions/calling/recordings/ready
with the
engagementId
for the call that was created. This will notify HubSpot that the recording is ready and transcription can begin.
The body of an example request is shown below:
Copy code snippet
// Example POST request to log a recording as being ready for a call
{
"engagementId": 17591596434
}
xxxxxxxxxx
4
1
// Example POST request to log a recording as being ready for a call
2
{
3
"engagementId"
:
17591596434
4
}
Please note:
If you're using the legacy approach of logging call recordings without authentication, please update to the authenticated approach before September 2024. After this time, the unauthenticated approach will no longer be supported.

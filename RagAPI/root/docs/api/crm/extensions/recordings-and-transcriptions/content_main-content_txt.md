# HubSpot Calling Extensions: Recordings and Transcriptions

This document outlines the process of integrating call recordings and transcriptions into your HubSpot account using the HubSpot API.  This involves creating an endpoint to serve authenticated recording URLs, registering that endpoint with HubSpot, logging calls via the engagements API, and finally marking recordings as ready for transcription.

## Requirements

* **HubSpot Paid Seats:** Only users with paid Sales or Services hub seats can have their calls transcribed.
* **Audio File Format:** Only .WAV, .FLAC, and .MP4 audio files are supported.
* **Octet-Stream Download:** The audio file must be downloadable as an octet-stream.
* **Multi-Channel Audio:** Each speaker should be on a separate audio channel. For two-channel calls, the caller should be on channel 1 and the recipient on channel 2.
* **Range Header Support:** To enable fast forward/rewind functionality in HubSpot, the recording URL endpoint must support the `Range` header and return a `206 Partial Content` status code for partial content requests.


## 1. Create an Endpoint for Authenticated Recording URLs

Create an endpoint that retrieves authenticated call URLs.  This endpoint will be called by HubSpot to access recordings.

**Endpoint Parameters:**

* `externalId` (path parameter): Unique ID of the call URL.  Matches the `hs_call_external_id` property in the engagements API call.
* `externalAccountId` (query parameter): Unique ID of the HubSpot account associated with the call.
* `appId` (query parameter): Your app's ID.

**Response (JSON):**

```json
{
  "authenticatedUrl": "https://your-app.com/retrieve/recording/externalId"
}
```

**Example:**

A GET request to `https://your-app.com/retrieve/recording/test-call-01?externalAccountId=test-account-01&appId=your-app-id` should return the above JSON response.


## 2. Register Your Endpoint with HubSpot (Calling Settings API)

Register your endpoint using the Calling Settings API.

**API Endpoint:**

`/crm/v3/extensions/calling/{appId}/settings/recording`

**Request Method:** `POST` (to register) or `PATCH` (to update)

**Request Body (JSON):**

```json
{
  "urlToRetrieveAuthedRecording": "https://your-app.com/retrieve/recording/%s" 
}
```

The `%s` placeholder will be replaced by HubSpot with the `externalId`.  The entire URL, including `https://`, must be provided.


## 3. Log a Call with the Engagements API

Log the call using the Engagements API.  Include the necessary properties to link the call to your recording endpoint.

**API Endpoint:**

`/crm/v3/objects/calls`

**Request Method:** `POST`

**Request Body (JSON):**

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "hs_timestamp": "2023-10-27T10:00:00Z",
    "hs_call_title": "Example Call",
    "hubspot_owner_id": "12345", // HubSpot user ID
    "hs_call_body": "Call summary",
    "hs_call_duration": "60", // seconds
    "hs_call_from_number": "+15551234567",
    "hs_call_to_number": "+15557654321",
    "hs_call_source": "INTEGRATIONS_PLATFORM",
    "hs_call_status": "COMPLETED",
    "hs_call_app_id": "your-app-id",
    "hs_call_external_id": "test-call-01",
    "hs_call_external_account_id": "test-account-01"
  }
}
```

**Association with Record:** After creating the call object, associate it with a record (e.g., contact) using a `PUT` request to `/crm/v3/objects/calls/{callId}/associations/{toObjectType}/{toObjectId}/{associationType}`.  Replace placeholders with the appropriate IDs.


## 4. Mark a Call Recording as Ready

Notify HubSpot that the recording is ready for transcription.

**API Endpoint:**

`/crm/v3/extensions/calling/recordings/ready`

**Request Method:** `POST`

**Request Body (JSON):**

```json
{
  "engagementId": 1234567 // The ID of the call created in step 3
}
```

## Important Note:

The legacy unauthenticated approach for logging call recordings will be deprecated after September 2024.  Migrate to the authenticated approach described above before then.

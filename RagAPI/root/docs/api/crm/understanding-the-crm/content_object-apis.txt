Understanding the CRM APIs
Understanding the CRM APIs
The foundation of your HubSpot account is a database of your business relationships and processes, called the CRM (Customer Relationship Management). To manage this data, HubSpot accounts include objects, which represent types of relationships or processes. Individual instances of objects, called records, represent the individual entities under each object type (e.g., John Smith is a contact). To store data in each record, you'll use properties (e.g., the email property) and to represent the relationships between individual entities, you can associate records with one another (e.g., associate John Smith with a company Smith & Co.) Further, CRM records can also store information about interactions through associated engagements/activities, such as emails, calls, and meetings.Below, learn about CRM objects, records, properties, associations, pipelines, and searching the CRM. To learn more about managing your CRM database from within HubSpot, check out
HubSpot's Knowledge Base
.
Object APIs
The object APIs provide access to records and activities. For supported objects, you can use object endpoints and replace the
{objectTypeId}
in the request URL with the desired object. For example, to create contacts, you'd make a
POST
request to
crm/v3/objects/0-1
and to create courses, the request would be to
crm/v3/objects/0-410
.Refer to
this article
for more information about using the object endpoints for various objects.
Please note
: some objects have limited API functionality. For more details, click the link to an object's endpoints reference documentation in the table below. If an object listed doesn't have its own doc, you can refer to the
objects API
doc and substitute the
{objectTypeId}
in each endpoint to your desired object.
Object type IDs
When using CRM and other APIs, you'll need to use the
objectTypeId
field, which is a unique numerical value assigned to each object. For example, to retrieve records, you'd make a
GET
request to
/crm/v3/objects/{objectTypeId}
, or when creating a property for an object, you'd make a
POST
request to
/crm/v3/properties/{objectTypeId}
.The object type ID values are listed in the table below:

Users
Represent the users in your HubSpot account. Users cannot be associated with other objects, but can be retrieved and updated via API. View the
user details API
You can always use the numerical type ID value, but in some cases, you can also use the object's name for contacts, companies, deals, tickets, or notes. For example:
When starting an import with the
imports API
, the
columnObjectTypeId
specifies which object the data in your file belongs to. To import data for contacts, your value for
columnObjectTypeId
could be
contact
or
0-1
.
When using the
associations API
, the
fromObjectType
and
toObjectType
values specify the objects and the direction of the association. To view association types for contacts to companies, your
GET
request URL could be
crm/v4/associations/contact/company/labels
or
crm/v4/associations/0-1/0-2/labels
.
Unique identifiers and record IDs
A unique identifier is a value that differentiates one record in the CRM from another, even if they have otherwise identical information. For example, a database might have records for two people named John Smith. To avoid accidentally sending money to the wrong John Smith, each record is assigned a number as their
Record ID
.When a record is created in HubSpot, its
Record ID
(
hs_object_id
) is automatically generated and should be treated as a string. Record IDs are unique within an object, so there can be both a contact and company with the same ID. For contacts and companies, there are additional unique identifiers, including a contact's
email
and a company's
domain
name. For contacts, companies, deals, tickets, appointments, courses, listings, services, and custom objects, you can also
create custom unique identifier properties
.In the CRM APIs, you'll use unique identifier values to identify and manage specific records. You can always use a record's
hs_object_id
value, but can also use custom unique identifier properties for certain endpoints, specified by the
idProperty
parameter. For example, to edit a contact, you could make a
PATCH
request to
/crm/v3/objects/0-1/{contactId}
or
/crm/v3/objects/0-1/{contactEmail}?idProperty=email
.Learn more about how HubSpot handles deduplication in the
Knowledge Base
.
Associations API
In HubSpot, you can show how objects are related to one another by associating their records. For example, you can associate multiple contacts with a company, and then associate the company and relevant contacts with a deal.When using the
associations API endpoints
, you can substitute objects for
{toObjectTypeId}
and
{fromObjectTypeId}
in the request URLs and request bodies. Before associating records across objects, to understand which objects can be associated to one another, you can
retrieve association types.
For example, contacts can be associated with most objects, while quotes can only be associated with contacts, companies, deals, and line items.Depending on your subscription, you can describe the specific relationship types between records using
association labels
, and your account may have additional custom objects, which can be associated with the other standard objects. Learn more about object relationships and managing associations using the
associations endpoints
.If you have access to a HubSpot account, you can also review your account's unique object relationships by navigating to
the data model tool.
Properties API
Information about records are stored in fields called properties, which are then organized into
groups
. HubSpot provides a set of default properties for each object. In addition to each object’s default properties, you can store custom data by
creating custom properties
. When using the properties API, you can substitute objects in the endpoints to create and manage an object's properties. For example,
/crm/v3/properties/0-1
for contact properties or
/crm/v3/properties/0-5
for ticket properties.Learn more about using the properties API in
this article
.
Search API
To filter and sort records and activities based on their properties and associations, you can use the search API. When using the search endpoints, substitute the
{objectTypeId}
value for the object within which you want to search. For example, to search calls, you'd make a POST request to
/crm/v3/objects/0-48/search
.Learn more about how to use CRM search API in
this article
.
Pipelines API
In HubSpot, you can use pipelines to track records through stages in your processes. For example, you can track deals through a sales processes or tickets through support statuses. Using the pipelines API, you can create, retrieve, edit, and delete pipelines and pipeline stages.Learn which objects have pipelines and how to use pipelines API in

CRM API |  Associations v4
Associations v4
For the previous version, please see the documentation for the
v3 Associations API
.
Associations represent the relationships between objects and activities in the HubSpot CRM. Record associations can exist between records of different objects (e.g., Contact to Company), as well as within the same object (e.g., Company to Company).
The v4 Associations API includes
Association
endpoints and
Association schema
endpoints:
Association endpoints
: create, edit, and remove associations between records.
Association schema endpoints
: view your account's association definitions (also known as types), create and manage custom association labels, and set limits for associations. Association labels are supported between contacts, companies, deals, tickets, and custom objects, and can be
used across HubSpot in tools
, such as lists and workflows.
Learn more about objects, records, properties, and associations APIs in the
Understanding the CRM
guide.
Please note
: the v4 Associations API is supported in Version 9.0.0 or later of the NodeJS HubSpot Client.
Associate records
To associate records with records with one another, use the
Association
endpoints.
Please note
: the number of associations a record can have depends on
the object and your HubSpot subscription.
Associate records without a label
You can create a default unlabeled association between two records, or set up unlabeled associations for records in bulk. To set up an individual default association between two records, make a
PUT
request to
/crm/v4/objects/{fromObjectType}/{fromObjectId}/associations/default/{toObjectType}/{toObjectId}
In the request URL, include:
fromObjectType
:
the ID of the object you're associating. To find the ID values, refer to this
list of object type IDs,
or for contacts, companies, deals, tickets, and notes, you can use the object name (e.g.,
contact
,
company
).
fromObjectId
:
the ID of the record to associate.
toObjectType
:
the ID of the object you're associating the record to. To find the ID values, refer to this
list of object type IDs,
or for contacts, companies, deals, tickets, and notes, you can use the object name (e.g.,
contact
,
company
).
toObjectId
:
the ID of the record to associate to.
For example, to associate a contact record whose ID is 12345 with a company record whose ID is
67891
, your request URL would be:
/crm/v4/objects/contact/12345/associations/default/company/67891
.
To associate records without a label in bulk, make a
POST
request to
crm/v4/associations/{fromObjectType}/{toObjectType}/batch/associate/default
. In the request body, include
objectId
values for the records you want to associate.
Associate records with a label
You can also associate records with labels for individual record pairs or multiple pairs of records in bulk.
To associate two records and set a label to describe the association, make a
PUT
request to
/crm/v4/objects/{objectType}/{objectId}/associations/{toObjectType}/{toObjectId}
. In the request URL, include the
id
values of the two records you're associating.
To bulk create labelled associations between records of the same objects, make a
POST
request to
/crm/v4/associations/{fromObjectType}/{toObjectType}/batch/create
. In the request body, include the
id
values of records to associate in addition to the required parameters below.
In the request body, include the following information to indicate the labeled association you want to create:
associationCategory
: either
HUBSPOT_DEFINED
(default label) or
USER_DEFINED
(custom label).
associationTypeId
: the numerical ID value for the label. If using a default label (e.g., Primary company), refer to this
list of default type IDs.
If you're using a custom label, you'll need to
retrieve the labels
between those objects.
For each association, depending on your
association limits
, you can include multiple labels.
Please note
: for cross-object and paired label relationships, ensure you use the
typeId
that refers to the correct direction (e.g., Contact to Company vs. Company to Contact, Employee to Manager vs. Manager to Employee).
For example, to associate a contact with a deal using a custom label:
1. Make a
GET
request to
/crm/v4/associations/contact/deal/labels
.
2. In the response, look at the
typeId
and
category
values for the label. The ID will be a number (e.g.,
36
), and the category will always be
USER_DEFINED
for custom labels.
3. Make a
PUT
request to
/crm/v4/objects/contact/{objectId}/associations/deal/{toObjectId}
with the following request body:
Copy code snippet
/// Example request body
[
{
"associationCategory": "USER_DEFINED",
"associationTypeId": 36
}
]
1
/// Example request body
2
[
3
{
4
"associationCategory"
:
"USER_DEFINED"
,
5
"associationTypeId"
:
36
6
}
7
]
A successful response will include the
id
values of the two associated records along with the
label
for the association. For the example above, the response would look like:
Copy code snippet
/// Example response
{
"fromObjectTypeId": "0-1",
"fromObjectId": 29851,
"toObjectTypeId": "0-3",
"toObjectId": 21678228008,
"labels": ["Point of contact"]
}

}
Retrieve associated records
You can retrieve a record's associations of a specific object.
To retrieve an individual record's associations of a specific object, make a
GET
request to
/crm/v4/objects/{fromObjectType}/{objectId}/associations/{toObjectType}
. In the request URL, include the record's object as the
fromObjectType
and its record ID as the
objectId
.
To retrieve a record's associated records of a specific object, make a
POST
request to
/crm/v4/associations/{fromObjectType}/{toObjectType}/batch/read
. In the request body, include the id values of records whose associated records you want to retrieve.
For example, to retrieve all company associations for two contacts, make a
POST
request to
/crm/v4/associations/contacts/companies/batch/read
. Your request would look like the following:
Copy code snippet
/// Example request
{
"inputs": [
{
"id": "33451"
},
{
"id": "29851"
}
]
}
xxxxxxxxxx

/// Example request
2
{
3
"inputs"
: [
4
{
5
"id"
:

6
},
7
{
8
"id"
:
"29851"
9
}
10
]
11
}
For both the basic and batch endpoints, the record ID values will be returned for each associated record, along with information to describe the association between the record, including the
label
,
category
, and
typeId
. For the example batch request above, the response would be:
Copy code snippet

Update record association labels
For existing associations, to update the association labels, you can use the basic and batch create endpoints. If an existing labeled association exists between two records, to
replace
the existing label, only include the new label in the request. If you want to append labels (i.e. add a new label and keep the existing label), include both labels in your request.
For example, if records are already associated with a label with the
typeId
of
30
, to keep that label while adding another label, your request would look like:
Copy code snippet
/// Example request body
[
{
"associationCategory": "USER_DEFINED",
"associationTypeId": 30
},
{
"associationCategory": "USER_DEFINED",
"associationTypeId": 37
}
]
xxxxxxxxxx

/// Example request body

"associationTypeId"

},
7
{
8
"associationCategory"
:
"USER_DEFINED"
,
9
"associationTypeId"
:
37
10
}
11
]
Remove record associations
You can delete all associations between records, or delete only associations of specific types (i.e. default or custom labels). When deleting all associations, the records will
not
be deleted, but they will no longer be associated with one another. If deleting a specific association type, the records will still be associated but the specified labels will be removed, with the exception of deleting the default unlabelled association type which will remove all other associations.
To remove all associations:
To remove all associations between two records, make a
DELETE
request to
/crm/v4/objects/{objectType}/{objectId}/associations/{toObjectType}/{toObjectId}
.
To batch remove all associations between records, make a
POST
request to
/crm/v4/associations/{fromObjectType}/{toObjectType}/batch/archive
. In the request body, include the
id
values of records for which you want to remove all of their associations.
For example, to remove all associations between sets of contacts and companies, your request would look like:
Copy code snippet
/// Example request body POST crm/v4/associations/contacts/companies/batch/archive
[
{
"from": {
"id": "12345"
},
"to": [
{
"id": "67891"
}
]
},
{
"from": {
"id": "9876"
},
"to": [
{
"id": "54321"
}
]
}
]
}
xxxxxxxxxx

/// Example request body POST crm/v4/associations/contacts/companies/batch/archive
2
[
3
{
4
"from"
: {
5
"id"
:
"12345"
6
},
7
"to"
: [
8
{
9
"id"
:
"67891"
10
}
11
]
12
},
13
{
14
"from"
: {
15
"id"
:
"9876"
16
},
17
"to"
: [
18
{
19
"id"
:
"54321"
20
}
21
]
22
}
23
]
24
}
To remove specific association labels, make a
POST
request to
/crm/v4/associations/{fromObjectType}/{toObjectType}/batch/labels/archive
. In the request body, include an array with
id
values of the associated records and the
associationTypeId
and
category
values of label(s) to remove.
For example, to remove a custom label from an association, but keep the unlabeled association, your request would look like:
Copy code snippet
/// Example request body POST crm/v4/associations/contacts/companies/batch/labels/archive
{
"inputs": [
{
"types": [
{
"associationCategory": "USER_DEFINED",
"associationTypeId": 37
}
],
"from": {
"id": "29851"
},
"to": {
"id": "5790939450"
}
}
]
}
xxxxxxxxxx
19
1
/// Example request body POST crm/v4/associations/contacts/companies/batch/labels/archive
2
{
3
"inputs"
: [
4
{
5
"types"
: [
6
{
7
"associationCategory"
:
"USER_DEFINED"
,
8
"associationTypeId"
:
37
9
}
10
],
11
"from"
: {
12
"id"
:
"29851"
13
},
14
"to"
: {
15
"id"
:
"5790939450"
16
}
17
}
18
]
19
}
If you then retrieve that contact's company associations, now only the unlabelled association type will be returned for the above associated company:
Copy code snippet
/// Example response GET crm/v4/objects/contacts/29851/associations/companies
{
"results": [

Report on high association usage
There are technical
limits to the number of associations a record can have
. You can use the associations API to retrieve a report of records that are either approaching or have hit the maximum limit for associations.
To retrieve the report, make a
POST
request to
crm/v4/associations/usage/high-usage-report/{userID}
. The file includes records using 80% or more of their association limit. For example, if a company can be associated with up to 50,000 contacts, the company will be included in the file if it has 40,000 or more associated contacts. The file will be sent to the email of the user whose ID was included in the request URL. Learn how to retrieve user IDs with the
users API
.
Understand association definitions, configurations, and labels
To manage association definition (a.k.a association type) configurations and labels, use the
Association schema
endpoints. These endpoints include configuration endpoints and label endpoints. You should use the endpoints for the following goals:
Association definitions (labels)
: create and manage association types, including creating, editing, and deleting custom association labels. For example, create a
Billing contact
label between contacts and deals or a
Manager
and
Employee
paired label between contacts.
Association definition configurations
: set and manage limits for how many associations can exist per association type. For example, allow up to five associated deals per company or only one associated contact with the
Decision maker
label per company.
HubSpot defined associations
HubSpot provides a set of predefined association types (e.g., unlabeled contact to company), but account admins can
define their own association labels
to provide additional context for record relationships (e.g., manager and employee). There are two HubSpot-defined association types:
Primary:
the main company that the other record is associated with. Primary associations can be used in HubSpot tools such as
lists and workflows
. For records with multiple associated companies, this API supports changing which company is considered the primary.
Unlabeled:
an association added when any contact, company, deal, ticket, or custom object record is associated. This type denotes that an association exists, and will always
returned
in responses with a
label
value of
null
. When a record has a primary association or a custom association label, those types will be
listed alongside the unlabeled association type
.
You can view all of the HubSpot-defined association types in
this section
.
Custom association labels
You can create association labels to further define record associations. For example, you could create a
Decision maker
label to indicate which contacts at a company are responsible for making purchasing decisions.
Learn more about
creating association labels below
.
Create and manage association types
Use the definitions endpoints to create custom labeled association types and review or manage existing types.
Create association labels
You can create custom labeled association types
in HubSpot
or through the association schema API endpoint. You can create up to 10 association labels between each object pairing (e.g. contacts and companies, contacts and contacts).
There are two types of
association labels
you can use to describe the relationships between records:
Single:
one label that applies to both records in the relationship. For example,
Friend
or
Colleague
.
Paired
: a pair of labels for when different words are used to describe each side of the associated records' relationship. For example,
Parent
and
Child
or
Employer
and
Employee
. To create paired labels, you must include the
inverseLabel
field in your request to name the second label in the pair.
To create a labeled association type, make a
POST
request to
/crm/v4/associations/{fromObjectType}/{toObjectType}/labels
and include the following in your request:
name
: the internal name of the association type. This value
cannot
include hyphens or begin with a numerical character.
label
: the name of the
association label as shown in HubSpot
.
inverseLabel
(paired labels only): the name of the second label in the pair of labels.
For example, your request could look similar to the following:
Copy code snippet
///Example request body - Single label
{
"label": "Partner",
"name": "partner"

In the response, the new association label's
category
and unique
typeId
will be returned, which you can use to retrieve, update, or delete the label moving forward. For paired labels, there'll be a value for each direction of the association (e.g.,
550
for contact to company and
551
for company to contact). For example, for the paired label request above, the response would look like:
Copy code snippet
///Example response
{
"results": [
{
"category": "USER_DEFINED",
"typeId": 145,
"label": "Employee"
},
{
"category": "USER_DEFINED",
"typeId": 144,
"label": "Manager"
}
]
}

11
"typeId"
:
144
,
12
"label"
:
"Manager"
13
}
14
]
15
}
Once created, you can now add the label when
associating records
.
Retrieve association labels
To view the association types between specific objects, make a
GET
request to
/crm/v4/associations/{fromObjectType}/{toObjectType}/labels
.
You'll receive an array, each item containing:
category
:
whether the association type was created by HubSpot (
HUBSPOT_DEFINED
) or by a user (
USER_DEFINED
).
typeId
:
the numeric ID for that association type. This is used to
set a label when associating records
. Refer to
this list
for all the HubSpot defined
typeId
values.
label
:
the alphanumeric label. This will be
null
for the unlabeled association type.
You can also find these values in HubSpot
in your association settings
.
For example, to view all association types from contacts to companies, make a
GET
request to
/crm/v4/associations/contacts/companies/labels
. Your response would look similar to the following:
Copy code snippet
///Example response
{
"results": [
{
"category": "HUBSPOT_DEFINED",
"typeId": 1,

{

Update association labels
You can edit the
label
field for association types, which updates the name as it appears in HubSpot in your settings and on records. You
cannot
change the internal
name
or
typeId
.
To update a label, make a
PUT
request to
/crm/v4/associations/{fromObjectType}/{toObjectType}/labels
. In the request body, including the
associationTypeId
and a new value for
label
. If editing a paired label, you can also include a new value for
inverseLabel
.
Using the example in the section above, to update the label
Contractor
to
Contract worker
, your request would look like:
Copy code snippet
///Example request
{
"associationTypeId": 32,
"label": "Contract worker"
}
xxxxxxxxxx
5
1
///Example request
2
{
3
"associationTypeId"
:
32
,
4
"label"
:
"Contract worker"
5
}
Delete association labels
You can delete custom association labels if they're no longer in use. If a label is used to describe associated records, you'll need to
remove the label
from associations before deleting. Default association types, including the
Primary company
label,
cannot
be deleted.
To delete an association label, make a
DELETE
request to
/crm/v4/associations/{fromObjectType}/{toObjectType}/labels/{associationTypeId}
. You'll no longer be able to use this label when associating records.
Set and manage association limits
Use the definition configuration endpoints to set up
limits
for the number of associated records between objects, or how often a label can be used to describe associations. There are also
technical limits and limits based on your HubSpot subscription
.
Create or update association limits
You can create new or update existing association limits between objects.
To create limits, make a
POST
request to
crm/v4/associations/definitions/configurations/{fromObjectType}/{toObjectType}/batch/create
.
To update existing limits, make a
POST
request to
crm/v4/associations/definitions/configurations/{fromObjectType}/{toObjectType}/batch/update
.
In the request body, include
inputs
with the following:
Parameter
Description
category
The category of the association you're setting a limit for, either
HUBSPOT_DEFINED
or
USER_DEFINED
.
typeId
The numeric ID for the association type you want to set a limit for. Refer to
this list
of default
typeId
values or
retrieve the value
for custom labels.
maxToObjectIds
The maximum number of associations allowed for the association type.
For example, to set limits that a deal can be associated with a maximum of five contacts with only one contact labelled
Point of contact
for a deal, your request would look like the following:
Copy code snippet
///Example request POST crm/v4/associations/definitions/configurations/deal/contact/batch/create
{
"inputs": [
{
"category": "HUBSPOT_DEFINED",
"typeId": 3,
"maxToObjectIds": 5
},
{
"category": "USER_DEFINED",
"typeId": 35,
"maxToObjectIds": 1
}
]
}
xxxxxxxxxx

///Example request POST crm/v4/associations/definitions/configurations/deal/contact/batch/create
2
{

"inputs"
: [

{
5

:
"HUBSPOT_DEFINED"
,
6
"typeId"
:

,

"maxToObjectIds"
:

8
},
9
{

:
"USER_DEFINED"
,
11
"typeId"
:
35
,
12
"maxToObjectIds"
:
1
13
}
14
]
15
}
Retrieve association limits
To read all defined association limits, make a
GET
request to
/crm/v4/associations/definitions/configurations/all
. This will return custom association limits defined across all objects.
To read association limits between two specific objects, make a
GET
request to
/crm/v4/associations/definitions/configurations/{fromObjectType}/{toObjectType}
.
For both requests, the response will return the associations' values for
category
,
typeId
,
maxToObjectIds
, and
label
. For example, if retrieving limits between deals and contacts, the response would look similar to:
Copy code snippet
///Example response GET crm/v4/associations/definitions/configurations/deal/contact
{
"results": [
{
"category": "HUBSPOT_DEFINED",
"typeId": 3,
"userEnforcedMaxToObjectIds": 5,
"label": null
}
]
}
xxxxxxxxxx

,
6
"typeId"
:

,
7
"userEnforcedMaxToObjectIds"
:
5
,
8
"label"
:
null
9
}
10
]
11
}
Delete association limits
To delete specific association limits, make a
POST
request to
/crm/v4/associations/definitions/configurations/{fromObjectType}/{toObjectType}/batch/purge
. In the request body, include the
category
and
typeId
values of the association types for which you want to remove limits.
For example, to remove the
Point of contact
limit between deals and contacts, the request would look like:
Copy code snippet
///Example request POST crm/v4/associations/definitions/configurations/deal/contact/batch/purge
{
"inputs": [
{
"category": "USER_DEFINED",
"typeId": 35
}
]
}
xxxxxxxxxx

1
///Example request POST crm/v4/associations/definitions/configurations/deal/contact/batch/purge
2
{
3
"inputs"
: [
4
{
5
"category"
:
"USER_DEFINED"
,
6
"typeId"
:
35
7
}
8
]
9
}
If successful, you'll receive a 204 response and the included limit will return to the system default (i.e. Many contacts can have the label
Point of contact
).
Limitations

500,000 requests
Enterprise
accounts:
500,000 requests

not
increase for association API requests if you purchase an additional API limit increase.
Burst limits:
Free
and
Starter
accounts:
100 requests per 10 seconds
Professional
and
Enterprise
accounts:
150 requests per 10 seconds
If you purchase the
API limit increase
, you can make a maximum of 200 requests per 10 seconds. This maximum will
not
increase for association API requests if you purchase an additional API limit increase.
Learn more about API limits in
this article
.
Association type ID values
The following tables include the HubSpot-defined
associationTypeId
values that specify the type of association. Association types vary depending on the included objects and the direction of the association (e.g., Contact to Company is different from Company to Contact). If you create custom objects or custom association labels, the related association types will have unique
typeId
values that you'll need to
retrieve
or locate in your
association settings in HubSpot
.
Please note
: default company association types include an unlabeled association type and a primary association type. If a record has more than one associated company, only one can be the primary company. The other associations can either be unlabelled or have custom association labels.

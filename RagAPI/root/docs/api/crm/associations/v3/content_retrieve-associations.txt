CRM API | Associations
Associations v3
The
new version of the Associations API
has additional functionality, including creating and managing association labels. Refer to the
v4 Associations API article
for more information.
Associations represent the relationships between objects and activities in the HubSpot CRM. You can use the v3 associations endpoints to create, retrieve, or remove associations in bulk.
Learn more about objects, records, properties, and associations APIs in the
Understanding the CRM
guide. For more general information about objects and records in HubSpot,
learn how to manage your CRM database
.
Association types
Associations are defined by object and direction. Association types are unidirectional, which means you'll need to use a different definition depending on the starting object type. Each endpoint requires a
{fromObjectType}
and
{toObjectType}
that tell the direction of the association.
For example:
To view all the defined association types from contacts to companies, you'd make a request to
/crm/v3/associations/contacts/companies/types
.
To see all tickets associated with a contact, you'd make a request to
/crm/v3/associations/Contacts/Tickets/batch/read
and identify the contact in the request body by its
objectId
. In this example, Contacts is the
fromObjectType
, and Tickets is the
toObjectType
.
Association types can include unlabeled associations (e.g., contact-to-company), default labeled associations (e.g., contact-to-primary company), and custom labeled associations (e.g.,
Decision maker
contact-to-company).
Retrieve association types
To view all the defined association types between objects, including default associations and custom association labels, make a
GET
request to
/crm/v3/associations/{fromObjectType}/{toObjectType}/types
.
Each type will have a returned numerical
id
value and
name
that can be used to reference the association type in other requests. For default associations, the numerical ID will be the same for all accounts, but for custom association labels, the ID will be unique to your account.
For example, your response would look similar to the following:

While you can reference custom association types (i.e. labels) with the v3 Associations API, you cannot use the API to create or edit new labels. Learn how to create, update, and delete labels in the
v4 Associations API article
.
Create associations
To
associate records
, make a
POST
request to
/crm/v3/associations/{fromObjectType}/{toObjectType}/batch/create
. In your request, include the
id
values for the records you want to associate, as well as the
type
of the association.
For example, to associate contacts to companies, your request URL would be
/crm/v3/associations/Contacts/Companies/batch/create
, and your request would look similar to the following:

Retrieve associations
To retrieve associated records, make a
POST
request to
/crm/v3/associations/{fromObjectType}/{toObjectType}/batch/read
. In your request, include the
id
values of the records whose associations you want to view. This will be for the
{fromObjectType}
.
For example, to retrieve deals associated with companies, your request URL would be
/crm/v3/associations/Companies/Deals/batch/read
and the request body would look like the following, with
id
values for the companies whose deal associations you want to view:
Copy code snippet
///Example request POST /crm/v3/associations/Companies/Deals/batch/read
{
"inputs": [
{
"id": "5790939450"
},
{
"id": "6108662573"
}
]
}

6
},

{
8
"id"
:
"6108662573"
9
}
10
]
11
}
In your response, you'll receive the
id
values of all associated records. For the above example, your response would include the
id
values for all associated deals and the association
type
. The response would look similar to the following:
Copy code snippet
///Example response POST /crm/v3/associations/Companies/Deals/batch/read
{

Please note
: when retrieving records associated with companies (i.e.
crm/v3/associations/{fromObjectType}/companies/batch/read
), only the
primary associated company
will be returned. To view all associated companies, use the
V4 associations API.
Remove associations
To remove associations between records, make a
POST
request to
/crm/v3/associations/{fromObjectType}/{toObjectType}/batch/archive
. In the request body, include the
id
values for the from record and the to record, as well as their association type.
For example, to remove the association between a company and a deal, your request would look like:
Copy code snippet
///Example request POST crm/v3/associations/companies/deals/batch/archive
{
"inputs": [
{
"from": {
"id": "5790939450"
},
"to": {
"id": "21678228008"
},
"type": "company_to_deal"
}
]

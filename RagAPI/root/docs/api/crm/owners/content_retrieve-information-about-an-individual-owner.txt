CRM API | Owners
Owners
Owners endpoint reference
HubSpot owners
assign
specific users to records, activities, or marketing tasks, and can be used in personalization tokens for your content. Owners are automatically created and updated in HubSpot when new users are added or existing owners are synced from
Salesforce
.
The owners API endpoints are read-only, so you can use them to retrieve an owner's identifying details, including the owner ID. This identifier can then be used to assign ownership to CRM records in HubSpot, via an integration, or via property change API calls.
Retrieve a list of owners
To retrieve the current owners in your account, make a
GET
request to
/crm/v3/owners
. The response will return each user's name, email, ID values, create/update dates, and if applicable, team information. Two ID values are returned, which are used for different purposes:
id
: the ID of the owner. This value should be used when retrieving information about a specific owner, and when assigning an owner to a record or activity.
userId
: the ID of the user. This value can be used to specify users in the
settings API
, but will result in an error if it is used to assign ownership.
Your response will look similar to the following:

You can also retrieve archived owners to view users that were deactivated. To do so, add the
archived
parameter with the value
true
. For archived users, there is still an
id
value, but the
userId
value will be
null
. The user ID is instead stored in the
userIdIncludingInactive
field.
For example:
Copy code snippet
///Example response GET crm/v3/owners/?archived=true
{
"results": [
{
"id": "42103462",
"email": "useremail@hubspot.com",
"type": "PERSON",
"firstName": "",
"lastName": "",
"userId": null,
"userIdIncludingInactive": 9685555,
"createdAt": "2020-01-09T20:28:50.080Z",
"updatedAt": "2020-01-09T20:28:50.080Z",
"archived": true
}
]

Retrieve information about an individual owner
To retrieve a specific owner, make a
GET
request to
/crm/v3/owners/{ownerId}
. You should use the
id
value to specify the owner for which you want more details.
Please note
: the
updatedAt
value in the response changes based on updates to the Owner object itself. It will not be updated for changes to the User object. For example, changing a user's permissions will
not
update the
updatedAt
value.

Companies
Companies endpoint reference
In HubSpot, companies store information about the organizations that interact with your business. The companies endpoints allow you to manage create and manage company records, as well as sync company data between HubSpot and other systems.
Learn more about objects, records, properties, and associations APIs in the
Understanding the CRM
guide. For more general information about objects and records in HubSpot,
learn how to manage your CRM database
.
Create companies
To create new companies, make a
POST
request to
/crm/v3/objects/companies
.
In your request, include your company data in a properties object. You can also add an associations object to associate your new company with existing records (e.g., contacts, deals), or activities (e.g., meetings, notes).
Properties
Company details are stored in company properties. There are
default HubSpot company properties
, but you can also
create custom properties
.
When creating a new company, you should include
at least one
of the following properties in your request:
name
or
domain
. It is recommended to always include
domain
, because domain names are the
primary unique identifier
to avoid duplicate companies in HubSpot. If a company has
multiple domains
, you can add them through the API by using the
hs_additional_domains
field with semicolons separating each domain. For example:
"hs_additional_domains" : "domain.com; domain2.com; domain3.com"
.
To view all available properties, you can retrieve a list of your account's company properties by making a
GET
request to
/crm/v3/properties/companies
. Learn more about the the
properties API
.
Please note:
if you've included
lifecyclestage
in your request, values must refer to the lifecycle stage's internal name. The internal names of default stages are text values, and do not change even if you edit the stage's
label
(e.g.,
subscriber
or
marketingqualifiedlead
). The internal names of
custom stages
are numeric values. You can find a stage's internal ID in your
lifecycle stage settings,
or by retrieving the lifecycle stage property via API.
For example, to create a new company, your request may look similar to the following:

Associations
When creating a new company, you can also associate the company with
existing records
or
activities
in an associations object. For example, to associate a new company with an existing contact and email, your request would look like the following:
JSON

In the associations object, you should include the following:
Parameter
Description
to
The record or activity you want to associate with the company, specified by its unique
id
value.
types
The type of the association between the company and the record/activity. Include the
associationCategory
and
associationTypeId
. Default association type IDs are listed
here
, or you can retrieve the value for custom association types (i.e. labels) via the
associations API
.
Retrieve companies
You can retrieve companies individually or in batches.
To retrieve an individual company, make a
GET
request to
/crm/v3/objects/companies/{companyId}
.
To request a list of all companies, make a
GET
request to
/crm/v3/objects/companies
.
For these endpoints, you can include the following query parameters in the request URL:
Parameter
Description
properties
A comma separated list of the properties to be returned in the response. If the requested company doesn't have a value for a property, it will not appear in the response.
propertiesWithHistory
A comma separated list of the current and historical properties to be returned in the response. If the requested company doesn't have a value for a property, it will not appear in the response.
associations
A comma separated list of objects to retrieve associated IDs for. Any specified associations that don't exist will not be returned in the response. Learn more about the
associations API.
To retrieve a batch of specific companies by record ID or a
custom unique identifier property
, make a
POST
request to
crm/v3/objects/companies/batch/read
. The batch endpoint
cannot
retrieve associations. Learn how to batch read associations with the
associations API
.
For the batch read endpoint, you can also use the optional
idProperty
parameter to retrieve companies by a custom
unique identifier property
. By default, the
id
values in the request refer to the record ID (
hs_object_id
), so the
idProperty
parameter is not required when retrieving by record ID. To use a custom unique value property to retrieve companies, you must include the
idProperty
parameter.
For example, to retrieve a batch of companies, your request could look like either of the following:
Copy code snippet
///Example request body with record ID
{
"properties": ["name", "domain"],
"inputs": [
{
"id": "56789"
},
{
"id": "23456"
}
]

},

{

}

]

}
To retrieve companies with current and historical values for a property, your request could look like:
Copy code snippet
///Example request body with record ID (current and historical values)
{
"propertiesWithHistory": ["name"],
"inputs": [
{
"id": "56789"
},
{
"id": "23456"
}
]
}

7
},
8
{
9
"id"
:
"23456"
10
}
11
]
12
}
Update companies
You can update companies individually or in batches. For existing companies, the company's record ID is a unique value that you can use to update the company via API.
To update an individual company by its company ID, make a
PATCH
request to
/crm/v3/objects/companies/{companyId}
, and include the data you want to update.
Please note
: if updating the
lifecyclestage
property, you can only set the value
forward
in the stage order. To set the lifecycle stage backward, you'll first need to clear the record's existing lifecycle stage value. The value can be
cleared manually
, or may be automatically cleared via a
workflow
or an integration that syncs contact data.
Associate existing companies with records and activities
To associate a company with other CRM records or an activity, make a
PUT
request to
/crm/v3/objects/companies/{companyId}/associations/{toObjectType}/{toObjectId}/{associationTypeId}
.
To retrieve the
associationTypeId
value, refer to
this list
of default values, or make a
GET
request to
/crm/v4/associations/{fromObjectType}/{toObjectType}/labels
.
Learn more about associating records with the
associations API
.
Remove an association
To remove an association between a company and a record or activity, make a
DELETE
request to the following URL:
/crm/v3/objects/companies/{companyId}/associations/{toObjectType}/{toObjectId}/{associationTypeId}
.
Pin an activity on a company record
You can pin an activity on a company record via API by including the
hs_pinned_engagement_id
field in your request. In the field, include the
id
of the activity to pin, which can be retrieved via the
engagements APIs
. You can pin one activity per record, and the activity must already be associated with the company prior to pinning.
To set or update a company's pinned activity, your request could look like:
Copy code snippet
///Example request body PATCH /crm/v3/objects/companies/{companyId}
{
"properties": {
"hs_pinned_engagement_id": 123456789
}
}
xxxxxxxxxx

///Example request body PATCH /crm/v3/objects/companies/{companyId}
2
{
3
"properties"
: {
4
"hs_pinned_engagement_id"
:
123456789
5
}
6
}
You can also create a company, associate it with an existing activity, and pin the activity in the same request. For example:
Copy code snippet
///Example request body POST /crm/v3/objects/companies
{
"properties": {
"domain": "example.com",
"name": "Example Company",
"hs_pinned_engagement_id": 123456789
},
"associations": [
{
"to": {
"id": 123456789
},
"types": [
{
"associationCategory": "HUBSPOT_DEFINED",
"associationTypeId": 189
}
]
}
]

Delete companies
You can delete companies individually or in batches, which will add the company to the recycling bin in HubSpot. You can later
restore the company within HubSpot
.
To delete an individual company by its ID, make a
DELETE
request to
/crm/v3/objects/companies/{companyId}
.
Learn more about batch deleting companies in the
reference documentation
.

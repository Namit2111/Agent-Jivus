Associations
To create and associate a task with existing records, include an associations object in your request. For example, to create a task and associate it with two contacts, your request body might look similar to the following:
Copy code snippet
// Example request body
{
"properties": {
"hs_timestamp": "2019-10-30T03:30:17.883Z",
"hs_task_body": "Send Proposal",
"hubspot_owner_id": "64492917",
"hs_task_subject": "Follow-up for Brian Buyer",
"hs_task_status": "WAITING",
"hs_task_priority": "HIGH",
"hs_task_type": "CALL"
},
"associations": [
{
"to": {
"id": 101
},
"types": [
{
"associationCategory": "HUBSPOT_DEFINED",
"associationTypeId": 204
}
]
},
{
"to": {
"id": 102
},
"types": [
{
"associationCategory": "HUBSPOT_DEFINED",
"associationTypeId": 204

Associate existing tasks with records
To associate an existing task with records (e.g., contacts, deals, etc.), make a
PUT

Field
Description
taskId
The ID of the task.
toObjectType
The type of object that you want to associate the task with (e.g., contact or company)
toObjectId
The ID of the record that you want to associate the task with.
associationTypeId
A unique identifier to indicate the association type between the task and the other object. The ID can be represented numerically or in snake case (e.g.,
task_to_contact
). You can retrieve the value through the
associations API
.
For example, your request URL might look similar to the following:
https://api.hubspot.com/crm/v3/objects/tasks/17687016786/associations/contacts/104901/204
Remove an association
To remove an association between a task and a record, make a
DELETE
request to the same URL as above:
/crm/v3/objects/tasks/{taskId}/associations/{toObjectType}/{toObjectId}/{associationTypeId}
Pin a task on a record

pin a task
on a record so it remains on the top of the record's timeline. The task must already be associated with the record prior to pinning, and you an only pin one activity per record. To pin a task, include the task's
id
in the
hs_pinned_engagement_id
field when creating or updating a record via the object APIs. Learn more about using the
companies,
contacts
,
deals
,
tickets
, and
custom objects
APIs.
Delete tasks
You can delete tasks individually or in batches, which will add the task to the recycling bin in HubSpot. You can later
restore the task from the record timeline
.
To delete an individual task by its task ID, make a
DELETE
request to
/crm/v3/objects/tasks/{taskId}
.

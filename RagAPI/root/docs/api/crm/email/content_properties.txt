Email
Email endpoint reference
Use the email engagement API to log and manage emails on CRM records. You can log email activities either
in HubSpot
or through the emails API.
Below, learn the basic methods of managing emails through the API. To view all available endpoints and their requirements, click the
Endpoints
tab at the top of this article.
Create an email
To create an email engagement, make a
POST
request to
/crm/v3/objects/emails
.
In the request body, add email details in a
properties
object. You can also add an
associations
object to associate your new email with an existing record (e.g., contacts, companies).
Properties
In the properties object, you can include the following fields:
Field
Description
hs_timestamp
Required. This field marks the email's time of creation and determines where the email sits on the record timeline. You can use either a Unix timestamp in milliseconds or UTC format.
hubspot_owner_id
The
ID of the owner
associated with the email. This field determines the user listed as the email creator on the record timeline.
hs_email_direction
The direction the email was sent in. Possible values include:
EMAIL
: the email was sent from the CRM or sent and logged to the CRM with the
BCC address.
INCOMING_EMAIL
: the email was a reply to a logged outgoing email.
FORWARDED_EMAIL
: the email was
forwarded to the CRM.
hs_email_html
The body of an email if it is sent from a CRM record.
hs_email_status
The send status of the email. The value can be
BOUNCED
,
FAILED
,
SCHEDULED
,
SENDING
, or
SENT
.
hs_email_subject
The subject line of the logged email.
hs_email_text
The body of the email.
hs_attachment_ids
The IDs of the email's attachments. Multiple attachment IDs are separated by a semi-colon.
hs_email_headers
The email's headers. The value for this property will automatically populate certain read only email properties. Learn how to
set email headers.
Learn more about batch creating email engagements by clicking the
Endpoints
tab at the top of this article.
Read only properties
There are also some email properties that are read only, which are automatically populated by HubSpot. The properties in the table below are all automatically populated from the
hs_email_headers
value.
Field
Description
hs_email_from_email
The email address of the email's sender.
hs_email_from_firstname
The email sender's first name.
hs_email_from_lastname
The email sender's last name.
hs_email_to_email
The email addresses of the email's recipients.
hs_email_to_firstname
The first names of the email's recipients.
hs_email_to_lastname
The last names of the email recipient.
Please note:
when retrieving an email header, you may notice there are values both for
From
and
Sender
. These are often the same, but because
Sender
identifies what actually submitted an email, there are scenarios where the values may differ. For example, if an email is sent from an email alias, the
From
value will refer to the user's actual email address, and the
Sender
value will refer to the email alias.
Set email headers
Since headers automatically populate the read only properties, you may want to manually set the email headers. To set the
hs_email_headers
value, you can use a JSON escaped string with the following data:
Copy code snippet
//Example data
{
"from": {
"email": "from@domain.com",
"firstName": "FromFirst",
"lastName": "FromLast"
},
"to": [
{
"email": "ToFirst ToLast<to@test.com>",
"firstName": "ToFirst",
"lastName": "ToLast"
}
],
"cc": [],
"bcc": []
}
1
//Example data
2
{
3
"from"
: {
4
"email"
:
"from@domain.com"
,
5
"firstName"
:
"FromFirst"
,
6
"lastName"
:
"FromLast"
7
},
8
"to"
: [
9
{
10
"email"
:
"ToFirst ToLast<to@test.com>"
,
11
"firstName"
:
"ToFirst"
,
12
"lastName"
:
"ToLast"
13
}
14
],
15
"cc"
: [],
16
"bcc"
: []
17
}
For example, your request to create an email may look like:
Copy code snippet
//Example request body
{
"properties": {
"hs_timestamp": "2019-10-30T03:30:17.883Z",
"hubspot_owner_id": "47550177",
"hs_email_direction": "EMAIL",
"hs_email_status": "SENT",
"hs_email_subject": "Let's talk",
"hs_email_text": "Thanks for youremail",
"hs_email_headers": "{\"from\":{\"email\":\"from@domain.com\",\"firstName\":\"FromFirst\",\"lastName\":\"FromLast\"},\"sender\":{\"email\":\"sender@domain.com\",\"firstName\":\"SenderFirst\",\"lastName\":\"SenderLast\"},\"to\":[{\"email\":\"ToFirst+ToLast<to@test.com>\",\"firstName\":\"ToFirst\",\"lastName\":\"ToLast\"}],\"cc\":[],\"bcc\":[]}"
}
}

Associations
To create and associate an email with existing records, include an associations object in your request. For example, to create an email and associate it with a deal and a contact, your request body might look like the following:
Copy code snippet
// Example request body
{
"properties": {
"hs_timestamp": "2019-10-30T03:30:17.883Z",
"hubspot_owner_id": "11349275740",
"hs_email_direction": "EMAIL",
"hs_email_status": "SENT",
"hs_email_subject": "Let's talk",
"hs_email_text": "Thanks for your interest let's find a time to connect"
},
"associations": [
{
"to": {
"id": 601
},
"types": [
{
"associationCategory": "HUBSPOT_DEFINED",
"associationTypeId": 210
}
]
},
{
"to": {
"id": 602
},
"types": [
{
"associationCategory": "HUBSPOT_DEFINED",
"associationTypeId": 198
}
]
}
]
}

associations API
.
Retrieve emails
You can retrieve emails individually or in bulk. Learn more about batch retrieval by clicking the
Endpoints
tab at the top of this article.
To retrieve an individual email by its email ID, make a
GET
request to
/crm/v3/objects/emails/{emailId}
. You can also include the following parameters in the request URL:
Parameter

.
In the request body, include the email properties that you want to update. For example, your request body might look similar to the following:
Copy code snippet
// Example request body

Associate existing emails with records
To associate an email with records, such as a contact and its associated companies, make a
PUT
request to
/crm/v3/objects/emails/{emailId}/associations/{toObjectType}/{toObjectId}/{associationTypeId}

Field

toObjectId
The ID of the record that you want to associate the email with.
associationTypeId
A unique identifier to indicate the association type between the email and the other object. The ID can be represented numerically or in snake case (e.g.,
email_to_contact
). You can retrieve the value through the
associations API
.
For example, your request URL might look similar to the following:
https://api.hubspot.com/crm/v3/objects/emails/17691787884/associations/contact/104901/198
Remove an association
To remove an association between an email and a record, make a
DELETE
request to the same URL as above:
/crm/v3/objects/emails/{emailId}/associations/{toObjectType}/{toObjectId}/{associationTypeId}
Pin an email on a record
You can
pin an email
on a record so it remains on the top of the record's timeline. The email must already be associated with the record prior to pinning, and you an only pin one activity per record. To pin an email, include the email's
id
in the
hs_pinned_engagement_id
field when creating or updating a record via the object APIs. Learn more about using the
companies,
contacts
,
deals
,
tickets
, and
custom objects
APIs.
Delete emails
When you delete an email, it is permanently deleted and
cannot
be restored. You can delete emails individually or in batches.
To delete an individual email by its email ID, make a
DELETE
request to
/crm/v3/objects/emails/{emailId}

Export CRM data endpoint reference
Use the exports API to export records and property data from your HubSpot account, retrieve a URL to download an export file, or see the status of an export. Within HubSpot, you can also
export records
or
view a log of past exports in your account.
Start an export
To start an export, make a
POST
request to
/crm/v3/exports/export/async
. Your request body should specify information such as the file format, the object and properties you want to export, and the type of export you're completing (e.g., exporting an object view or a list). You can also filter the property data to be exported based on specific operators.
For both view and list exports, you can include the following fields in your request:
Parameter
Description
exportType
The type of export, either
VIEW
(exports a view from an object index page) or
LIST
(exports a list).
format
The file format. Options include
XLSX
,
CSV
, or
XLS
.
exportName
The name of the export.
language
The language of the export file. Options include
DE
,
EN
,
ES
,
FI
,
FR
,
IT
,
JA
,
NL
,
PL
,
PT
, or
SV
. Learn more about
supported languages.
objectType
The name or ID of the object you're exporting. For standard objects, you can use the object's name (e.g.,
CONTACT
), but for custom objects, you must use the
objectTypeId
value. You can retrieve this value by making a
GET
request to
/crm/v3/schemas
.
associatedObjectType
The name or ID of an associated object to include in the export. If you include an associated object, the export will contain the associated record IDs of that object and the records' primary display property value (e.g., name). You can export only one associated object per request.
objectProperties
A list of the properties you want included in your export. By default, property names and values are shown as the human-readable labels, but you can request internal names and values using the
exportInternalValuesOptions
parameter.
exportInternalValuesOptions
Include this array to export the internal values for property names and/or property values. In the array, include
NAMES
to export internal names of properties (shown as column headers) and/or
VALUES
to export internal property values (e.g., numerical values for custom pipeline stages or timestamps instead of human-readable dates).
Export a view
If you're exporting an
index page view
, your
exportType
value should be
VIEW
, and you can include the following field to filter and sort the records you're exporting:
Parameter
Description
publicCrmSearchRequest
Indicates which data should be exported based on certain property values and search queries. You can include the following within the object:
filters
: the properties and property values to filter records by.
sorts
: the sort order of a property's values, either ascending,
ASC
, or descending,
DES
.
query
: a string to search the records' values for.
For example, to export a view of contacts and associated company records, filtered by the
email
property and with the internal values of property names and values, your request would look like the following:

, your
exportType
value should be

Retrieve exports
When you successfully complete an export, the export's
id
will be returned in the response. To retrieve an export from your HubSpot account, make a
GET
request to
/crm/v3/exports/export/async/tasks/{exportId}/status
.
When retrieving exports, the
status
of the export will also be returned. Possible statuses include
COMPLETE
,
PENDING
,
PROCESSING
, or
CANCELED
. For exports with a
COMPLETE
status, a URL is returned that you can use to download the exported file. The download URL will expire five minutes after the completed request. Once expired, you can perform another
GET
request to generate a new unique URL.
Please note
: prior to expiration, an export's download URL can be accessed without any additional authorization. To protect your data, proceed with caution when sharing a URL or integrating with HubSpot via this API.
Limits
The following limits apply:
When setting filters for your export, you can include a maximum of three
filterGroups
with up to three
filters
in each group.
You can complete up to thirty exports within a rolling 24 hour window, and one export at a time. Additional exports will be queued until the previous export is completed.
An exported CSV file will be automatically zipped if the resulting file is greater than 2MB.

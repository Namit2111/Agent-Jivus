Retrieve goals
You can retrieve an individual goal or all goals in your account.
To request all goals, make a
GET
request to
/crm/v3/objects/goal_targets
.
To retrieve an individual goal, make a
GET
request to
/crm/v3/objects/goal_targets/{goalTargetId}/
.
To retrieve goals that meet a specific set of criteria, you can make a
POST
request to the search endpoint and include filters in the request body. Learn more about
searching the CRM
.
For example, to retrieve a goal with an ID of
44027423340
, the request URL would be the following:
https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/goal_targets/44027423340/
The response will include a few default properties, including the create date, last modified date.

Goals properties
When making a
GET
request to the Goals API, you can also request specific goal properties:
hs_goal_name:
This is a string that denotes the name of a goal.
hs_target_amount:
Number that denotes the goal target value.
hs_start_datetime:
Goal's start date as a UTC timestamp.
hs_end_datetime:
Goal's end date as a UTC timestamp.
hs_created_by_user_id:
HubSpot UserId of the person who created the goal, not the one assigned to a goal.
For example, if you wanted to include all properties listed above, the request URL may resemble the following:
https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/goal_targets/44027423340?properties=hs_goal_name,hs_target_amount,hs_start_datetime,hs_end_datetime,hs_created_by_user_id

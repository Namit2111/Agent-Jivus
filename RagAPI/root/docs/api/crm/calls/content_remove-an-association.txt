Calls
Calls endpoint reference
Use the calls engagement API to log and manage calls on CRM records and on the
calls index page
. You can log calls either
in HubSpot
or through the calls API. Below, learn the basic methods of managing calls through the API. To view all available endpoints and their requirements, click the
Endpoints
tab at the top of this article.
Create a call engagement
To create a call engagement, make a
POST
request to
/crm/v3/objects/calls
.
In the request body, add call details in a
properties
object. You can also add an
associations
object to associate your new call with an existing record (e.g.,contacts, companies).
Properties
Below is a list of HubSpot default calling properties that you can include in the properties object. You can also create custom properties using the
properties API
.
Field
Description
hs_timestamp
Required. This field marks the call's time of creation and determines where the call sits on the record timeline. You can use either a Unix timestamp in milliseconds or UTC format.
hs_call_body
The description of the call, including any notes that you want to add.
hs_call_callee_object_id
The ID of the HubSpot record associated with the call. This will be the recipient of the call for
OUTBOUND
calls, or the dialer of the call for
INBOUND
calls.
hs_call_callee_object_type
The type of the object to which the call's associated record belongs (e.g., specifies if the record is a contact or company). This will be the object of the recipient for
OUTBOUND
calls, or the object of the dialer for
INBOUND
calls.
hs_call_direction
The direction of the call from the perspective of the HubSpot user. If the user is the call recipient, the direction should be set to
INBOUND
. If the user initiated the call, the direction should be set to
OUTBOUND
.
hs_call_disposition
The outcome of the call. To set the call disposition, you need to use the internal GUID value. If your account has set up
custom call outcomes
, you can find their disposition GUIDs using
this API
. The default HubSpot outcome labels and their internal values are:

The record you want to associate with the call, specified by its unique
id
value.

The type of the association between the call and the record. Include the

here
, or you can retrieve the value for custom association types (i.e. labels) via the
associations API
.
Learn more about batch creating calls by clicking the
Endpoints
tab at the top of this article.
Retrieve calls
You can retrieve calls individually or in bulk. Learn more about batch retrieval by clicking the
Endpoints
tab at the top of this article.
To retrieve an individual call by its call ID, make a
GET
request to
/crm/v3/objects/calls/{callId}
. You can include the following parameters in the request URL:
Parameter
Description
properties
A comma separated list of the
properties
to be returned.
associations
A comma separated list of object types to retrieve associated IDs for. Any specified associations that don't exist will not be returned in the response. Learn more about the
associations API.
To request a list of all of calls, make a
GET
request to
/crm/v3/objects/calls
. You can include the following parameters in the request URL:
Parameter
Description
limit
The maximum number of results to display per page.
properties
A comma separated list of the
properties
to be returned.
When you make a successful request, the response will include the
callId
which you can use to retrieve, update, and delete the call.
Identify voicemails vs. recorded calls
For recorded calls and voicemails, a recording is stored in the
hs_call_recording_url
property. If your account has access to
inbound calling
, to differentiate between calls that were completed and recorded vs. inbound calls with a voicemail, include the following properties in your request:
hs_call_status
and
hs_call_has_voicemail
.
If a call has a voicemail, the
hs_call_status
value will be
missed
, and the
hs_call_has_voicemail
value will be
true
. The
hs_call_has_voicemail
value will be
false
for an inbound call where no voicemail was left, or
null
if the call has a status other than missed.
Update calls
You can update calls individually or in batches. To update an individual call by its call ID, make a
PATCH
request to
/crm/v3/objects/calls/{callId}
.
In the request body, include the call properties that you want to update:
Copy code snippet
//Example PATCH request to https://api.hubspot.com/crm/v3/objects/calls/{callID}
{
"properties": {
"hs_timestamp": "2021-03-17T01:32:44.872Z",

HubSpot will ignore values for read-only and non-existent properties. To clear a property value, pass an empty string for the property in the request body.
Learn more about batch updating by clicking the
Endpoints
tab at the top of this article.
Associate existing calls with records
To associate a call with records, such as a contact and its associated companies, make a
PUT
request to
/crm/v3/objects/calls/{callId}/associations/{toObjectType}/{toObjectId}/{associationTypeId}
. The request URL contains the following fields:
Field
Description
callId
The ID of the call.
toObjectType
The type of object that you want to associate the call with (e.g., contact or company)
toObjectId
The ID of the record that you want to associate the call with.
associationTypeId
A unique identifier to indicate the association type between the call and the other object. The ID can be represented numerically or in snake case (e.g.,
call_to_contact
). You can retrieve the value through the
associations API
.
For example, your request URL might look similar to the following:
https://api.hubspot.com/crm/v3/objects/calls/17591596434/associations/contact/104901/194
Remove an association
To remove an association between a call and a record, make a
DELETE
request to the same URL as above:
/crm/v3/objects/calls/{callId}/associations/{toObjectType}/{toObjectId}/{associationTypeId}
Pin a call on a record
You can
pin a call
on a record so it remains on the top of the record's timeline. The call must already be associated with the record prior to pinning, and you an only pin one activity per record. To pin a call, include the call's
id
in the
hs_pinned_engagement_id
field when creating or updating a record via the object APIs. Learn more about using the
companies,
contacts
,
deals
,
tickets
, and
custom objects
APIs.
Delete calls
You can delete calls individually or in batches, which will add the call to the recycling bin in HubSpot. You can later
restore the call from the record timeline
.
To delete an individual call by its call ID, make a
DELETE
request to
/crm/v3/objects/calls/{callId}
.
Learn more about batch deleting by clicking the
Endpoints
tab at the top of this article.

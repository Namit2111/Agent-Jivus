Deals
Deals endpoint reference
In HubSpot, deals represent transactions with contacts or companies. Deals are tracked through your sales process in
pipeline stages
until they're won or lost. The deals endpoints allow you to manage create and manage deal records, as well as sync deal data between HubSpot and other systems.
Learn more about objects, records, properties, and associations APIs in the
Understanding the CRM
guide. For more general information about objects and records in HubSpot,
learn how to manage your CRM database
.
Create deals
To create new deals, make a
POST
request to
/crm/v3/objects/deals
.
In your request, include your deal data in a properties object. You can also add an associations object to associate your new deal with existing records (e.g., contacts, companies), or activities (e.g., meetings, notes).
Properties
Deal details are stored in deal properties. There are
default HubSpot deal properties
, but you can also
create custom properties
.
When creating a new deal, you should include the following properties in your request:
dealname
,
dealstage
and if you have multiple pipelines,
pipeline
. If a pipeline isn't specified, the default pipeline will be used.
To view all available properties, you can retrieve a list of your account's deal properties by making a
GET
request to
/crm/v3/properties/deals
. Learn more about the the
properties API
.
Please note
: you must use the internal ID of a deal stage or pipeline when creating a deal via the API. The internal ID will also be returned when you retrieve deals via the API. You can find a deal stage's or pipeline's internal ID in your
deal pipeline settings.
For example, to create a new deal, your request may look similar to the following:

Associations
When creating a new deal, you can also associate the deal with
existing records
or
activities
in an associations object. For example, to associate a new deal with an existing contact and company, your request would look like the following:

In the associations object, you should include the following:
Parameter
Description
to
The record or activity you want to associate with the deal, specified by its unique
id
value.
types
The type of the association between the deal and the record/activity. Include the
associationCategory
and
associationTypeId
. Default association type IDs are listed
here
, or you can retrieve the value for custom association types (i.e. labels) via the
associations API
.
Retrieve deals
You can retrieve deals individually or in batches.
To retrieve an individual deal, make a
GET
request to
/crm/v3/objects/deals/{dealId}
.
To request a list of all deals, make a
GET
request to
/crm/v3/objects/deals
.
For these endpoints, you can include the following query parameters in the request URL:
Parameter
Description
properties
A comma separated list of the properties to be returned in the response. If the requested deal doesn't have a value for a property, it will not appear in the response.
propertiesWithHistory
A comma separated list of the current and historical properties to be returned in the response. If the requested deal doesn't have a value for a property, it will not appear in the response.
associations
A comma separated list of objects to retrieve associated IDs for. Any specified associations that don't exist will not be returned in the response. Learn more about the
associations API.
To retrieve a batch of specific deals by record ID or a
custom unique identifier property
, make a
POST
request to
crm/v3/objects/deals/batch/read
. The batch endpoint
cannot
retrieve associations. Learn how to batch read associations with the
associations API
.
For the batch read endpoint, you can also use the optional
idProperty
parameter to retrieve deals by a custom
unique identifier property
. By default, the
id
values in the request refer to the record ID (
hs_object_id
), so the
idProperty
parameter is not required when retrieving by record ID. To use a custom unique value property to retrieve deals, you must include the
idProperty
parameter.
For example, to retrieve a batch of deals, your request could look like either of the following:
Copy code snippet
///Example request body with record ID
{
"properties": ["dealname", "dealstage", "pipeline"],
"inputs": [
{
"id": "7891023"

{

}

To retrieve deals with current and historical values for a property, your request could look like:
Copy code snippet
///Example request body with record ID (current and historical values)
{
"propertiesWithHistory": ["dealstage"],
"inputs": [
{
"id": "7891023"
},
{

{

10
}

]

}
Update deals
You can update deals individually or in batches. For existing deals, the deal ID is a default unique value that you can use to update the deal via API, but you can also identify deals using
custom unique identifier properties.
To update an individual deal by its record ID, make a
PATCH
request to
/crm/v3/objects/deals/{dealId}
, and include the data you want to update.
To update multiple deals, make a
POST
request to
/crm/v3/objects/deals/batch/update
. In the request body, include an array with the identifiers for the deals and the properties you want to update.
Associate existing deals with records or activities
To associate a deal with other CRM records or an activity, make a
PUT
request to
/crm/v3/objects/deals/{dealId}/associations/{toObjectType}/{toObjectId}/{associationTypeId}
.
To retrieve the
associationTypeId
value, refer to
this list
of default values, or make a
GET
request to
/crm/v4/associations/{fromObjectType}/{toObjectType}/labels
.
Learn more about associating records with the
associations API
.
Remove an association
To remove an association between a deal and a record or activity, make a
DELETE
request to the following URL:
/crm/v3/objects/deals/{dealId}/associations/{toObjectType}/{toObjectId}/{associationTypeId}
.
Pin an activity on a deal record
You can pin an activity on a deal record via API by including the
hs_pinned_engagement_id
field in your request. In the field, include the
id
of the activity to pin, which can be retrieved via the
engagements APIs
. You can pin one activity per record, and the activity must already be associated with the deal prior to pinning.
To set or update a deal's pinned activity, your request could look like:
Copy code snippet
///Example request body PATCH /crm/v3/objects/deals/{dealId}
{
"properties": {
"hs_pinned_engagement_id": 123456789
}
}
xxxxxxxxxx

///Example request body PATCH /crm/v3/objects/deals/{dealId}
2
{
3
"properties"
: {
4
"hs_pinned_engagement_id"
:
123456789
5
}
6
}
You can also create a deal, associate it with an existing activity, and pin the activity in the same request. For example:
Copy code snippet
///Example request body POST /crm/v3/objects/deals
{
"properties": {
"dealname": "New deal",
"pipelines": "default",
"dealstage": "contractsent",
"hs_pinned_engagement_id": 123456789
},
"associations": [
{
"to": {
"id": 123456789
},
"types": [
{
"associationCategory": "HUBSPOT_DEFINED",
"associationTypeId": 213
}
]
}
]
}

}

}
Delete deals
You can delete deals individually or in batches, which will add the deal to the recycling bin in HubSpot. You can later
restore the deal within HubSpot
.
To delete an individual deal by its ID, make a
DELETE
request to
/crm/v3/objects/deals/{dealId}
.
Learn more about batch deleting deals on the
Endpoints
tab at the top of this article.

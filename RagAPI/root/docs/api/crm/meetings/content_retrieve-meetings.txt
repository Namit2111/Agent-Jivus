Meetings endpoint reference
Use the meetings engagement API to log and manage meetings on CRM records. You can log meeting activities either
in HubSpot
or through the meetings API. You can retrieve, update, or delete meeting engagements that are manually logged on a record, scheduled using the
meetings tool
, or
scheduled using the Google Calendar or Office 365 calendar integration
.
Below, learn the basic methods of managing meetings through the API. To view all available endpoints and their requirements, click the
Endpoints
tab at the top of this article.
Create a meeting
To create a meeting engagement, make a
POST
request to
/crm/v3/objects/meetings
.
In the request body, add meeting details in a
properties
object. You can also add an
associations
object to associate your new meeting with an existing record (e.g., contacts, companies).
Properties
In the properties object, you can include the following fields:
Field
Description
hs_timestamp
Required. This field marks the date and time that the meeting occurred. You can use either a Unix timestamp in milliseconds or UTC format.(BETA) When the property value is missing, the value will default to
hs_meeting_start_time.
hs_meeting_title
The title of the meeting.
hubspot_owner_id
The
ID of the owner
associated with the meeting. This field determines the user listed as the meeting creator on the record timeline.
hs_meeting_body
The meeting description.
hs_internal_meeting_notes
The internal notes you take for your team during a meeting that are not included in the attendee meeting description.
hs_meeting_external_url
The external URL for the calendar event. For example, this could be a Google calendar link or a Microsoft Outlook calendar link.
hs_meeting_location
Where the meeting takes place. The value could be a physical address, a conference room, a videoconference link, or a phone number. This appears on the calendar invite on the attendee's calendar.
hs_meeting_start_time
The date and time when the meeting starts. The value for this property should match the value for
hs_timestamp
.
hs_meeting_end_time
The date and time when the meeting ends.
hs_meeting_outcome
The outcome of the meeting. The outcome values are scheduled, completed, rescheduled, no show, and canceled.
hs_activity_type
The type of meeting. The options are based on the
meeting types set in your HubSpot account.
hs_attachment_ids
The IDs of the meeting's attachments. Multiple attachment IDs are separated by a semi-colon.
Associations
To create and associate a meeting with existing records, include an associations object in your request. For example, to create and associate a meeting with contacts, your request may look similar to the following:

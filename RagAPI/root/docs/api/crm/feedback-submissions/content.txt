CRM API | Feedback Submissions
Please note:
this API is currently under development and is subject to change based on testing and feedback. By using these endpoints you agree to adhere to HubSpot's
Developer Terms
&
Developer Beta Terms
. You also acknowledge and understand the risk associated with testing an unstable API.
Feedback Submissions (BETA)
Feedback submissions endpoint reference
In HubSpot, feedback submissions store information submitted to a feedback survey. Surveys in HubSpot include
Net Promoter Score (NPS)
,
Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)
,
Customer Effort Score (CES)
, and
custom surveys
. Using the feedback submission endpoints, you can retrieve submission data about your feedback surveys.
Learn more about objects, properties, and associations APIs in the
Understanding the CRM
guide.
Please note
: the feedback submissions endpoints are currently read only. Feedback submissions cannot be submitted or edited through the API.
Retrieve feedback survey submissions
To view details about your feedback survey submissions, you can retrieve submission data in bulk for multiple surveys, or for an individual survey. For example, you can use the API to see all survey responses for a specific NPS survey.
To retrieve submissions, make a
GET
request to
/crm/v3/objects/feedback_submissions/{feedbackSubmissionId}
. By default, the following properties are returned for each submission:
hs_createdate
,
hs_lastmodifieddate
, and
hs_object_id
, but you also can retrieve additional
properties
.
For example, to retrieve survey submissions with the source and sentiment of the submissions, your request URL would look like:
https://api.hubspot.com/crm/v3/objects/feedback_submissions?properties=hs_sentiment,hs_survey_channel
.
Feedback submission properties
Feedback submissions have
default properties
that contain information about the survey, submission answers, and the date the survey was submitted. You can also
create custom submissions properties
.
Feedback submissions properties
cannot
be created or edited via API. You can only create properties in the
feedback surveys tool within HubSpot
, and the properties cannot be edited after creation.
Associations
Feedback submissions can be associated with contact and ticket records. Learn how to associate objects with the
associations API.

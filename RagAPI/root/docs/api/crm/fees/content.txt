Fees
Fees endpoint reference
When you're
creating a quote in HubSpot
, you can create and associate a fee as part of the pricing details of the quote.
Create a fee
Fees are used in conjunction with
discounts
and
taxes
when determining the pricing details for a quote. Any discounts you associate with your quote will be applied first, followed by associated fees, and then any associated taxes will apply.
To create a percentage fee:
Copy code snippet
// POST request to https://api.hubspi.com/crm/v3/objects/fee
{
"properties": {
"hs_label": "A percentage-based fee of 10%",
"hs_type": "PERCENT",
"hs_value": "10"
}
}

,

After you create a fee, you can use its ID to
associate it with a quote
. To retrieve a list of fees you've created, you can make a
GET
request to
/crm/v3/objects/fee
.

Users
User details endpoint reference
Use this API to fetch information about users in the account, along with updating their working hours, timezone, additional phone number, and job title properties. This API can be especially useful for syncing HubSpot user data with external workforce management tools.
For example, use these endpoints keep a user's working hours in sync with an external scheduling system.
Learn more about objects, records, properties, and associations APIs in the
Understanding the CRM
guide. For more general information about objects and records in HubSpot,
learn how to manage your CRM database
.
Retrieve users
Depending on the information you need, there are a few ways to retrieve HubSpot users:
To retrieve all users, make a
GET
request to
/crm/v3/objects/users/
.
To retrieve a specific user, make a
GET
request to the above URL and specify a user ID. For example:
crm/v3/objects/users/207838823235
.
To retrieve a batch of users by ID, make a
POST
request to
/crm/v3/objects/users/batch/read
.
To retrieve users that meet a specific set of criteria, you can make a
POST
request to
/crm/v3/objects/users/search
and include search filters in the request body. Learn more about
searching the CRM
.
Please note
: in a response for the users API,
id
and
hs_object_id
are the same and represent a user
only
in the HubSpot account from which the data was requested. This is different than the
id
values in the
user provisioning API
(
hs_internal_user_id
) which refers to a user across all accounts, and in the
owners API
(
hubspot_owner_id
) which refers to a user as an owner of records.
For example, the following response returns users, their unique identifiers within the selected HubSpot account, and information about when they were created or modified:

To return specific properties, include a
properties
query parameter in the request URL along with comma-separated property names. Learn more about
user properties below
.
For example, making a
GET
request to the following URL would result in the response below:
crm/v3/objects/users?properties=hs_job_title,hs_additional_phone
Copy code snippet
// Example response
{
"results": [
{

For the batch read endpoint, you can either retrieve users by their ID or by another
unique identifier property
by including an
idProperty
field.
For example, to read a batch of users, your request could look like either of the following:
Copy code snippet
///Example request body with internal ID
{
"properties": ["hs_job_title", "hs_additional_phone"],
"inputs": [
{
"id": "207838823235"
},
{
"id": "207840253600"
}
]
}

},
8
{

"id"
:
"207840253600"
10
}
11
]
12
}
Copy code snippet
///Example request body with a unique value property
{
"properties": ["hs_job_title", "hs_additional_phone"],
"idProperty": "externalIdProperty",
"inputs": [
{
"id": "0001111"
},
{
"id": "0001112"
}
]
}

{

"hs_additional_phone"

:
"externalIdProperty"
,
5
"inputs"

{

},
9
{
10
"id"
:
"0001112"
11
}
12
]
13
}
Update users
You can update users by ID individually or in batches.
To update an individual user, make a
PATCH
request to
/crm/v3/objects/users/{userId}
.
To update a batch of users, make a
POST
request to
/crm/v3/objects/users/batch/update
, including the user IDs or unique
idProperty
in the request body as shown in the section above.
For each endpoint, you'll need to include a request body that contains the properties you want to update.
For example, the request body below would update a user's timezone and working hours:
Copy code snippet
///Example request body
{
"properties": {
"hs_standard_time_zone": "America/Detroit",
"hs_working_hours": "[{\"days\":\"SATURDAY\",\"startMinute\":540,\"endMinute\":1020},{\"days\":\"WEDNESDAY\",\"startMinute\":540,\"endMinute\":1020}]"
}
}
xxxxxxxxxx

///Example request body

{

"properties"
: {

"hs_standard_time_zone"
:
"America/Detroit"
,
5
"hs_working_hours"
:
"[{\"days\":\"SATURDAY\",\"startMinute\":540,\"endMinute\":1020},{\"days\":\"WEDNESDAY\",\"startMinute\":540,\"endMinute\":1020}]"

}

}

Leads
Leads endpoint reference
In HubSpot,
leads
are contacts or companies that are potential customers who have shown interest in your products or services. The leads endpoints allow you to create and manage lead records in your HubSpot account, as well as sync lead data between HubSpot and other systems.
Before using the API, be sure leads have been
set up in your account
.
Learn more about objects, records, properties, and associations APIs in the
Understanding the CRM
guide. For more general information about objects and records in HubSpot,
learn how to manage your CRM database
.
Create leads
To create new contacts, make a
POST
request to
/crm/v3/objects/leads
.
In the request body, include any details about the lead in a
properties
object. Your new lead:
Must have a lead name, specified using the hs_lead_name property.
Must be associated with an existing contacts.
Should only be assigned to a user with a
seat
. (Leads can only be worked via the workspace).
For example, to create a warm lead named “Jane Doe” who has a type of New Business, your request body would resemble the following:

Properties
Lead details are stored in lead properties. There are
default HubSpot lead properties
, but you can also
create custom lead properties
.
To view all available properties, you can retrieve a list of your account's lead properties by making a
GET
request to
/crm/v3/properties/leads
. Learn more about the
properties API
.
See the table below for some common properties for leads:
PROPERTY
DESCRIPTION
Lead name
The full name of the lead.
Lead type
A dropdown list of lead types. You can edit or add new labels in your
lead property settings.
Lead label
The current status of the lead. You can edit or add new labels in your
lead property settings.
Associations
When creating a new lead you can also associate the lead with
existing records
or
activities
in an associations object. For example, to associate a new lead with an existing contact with an ID of 12345, your request would look like the following:

}
In the associations object, you should include the following:
Parameter
Description
to
The record or activity you want to associate with the lead, specified by its unique
id
value.
types
The type of the association between the lead and the record/activity. Include the
associationCategory
and
associationTypeId
. Default association type IDs are listed
here
, or you can retrieve the value for custom association types (i.e. labels) via the
associations API
.
Retrieve leads
You can retrieve leads individually or in batches.
To retrieve an individual lead, make a
GET
request to
/crm/v3/objects/leads/{leadsId}
.
To request a list of all leads, make a
GET
request to
/crm/v3/objects/leads
.
For these endpoints, you can include the following query parameters in the request URL:
Parameter
Description
properties
A comma separated list of the properties to be returned in the response. If the requested contact doesn't have a value for a property, it will not appear in the response.
propertiesWithHistory
A comma separated list of the current and historical properties to be returned in the response. If the requested contact doesn't have a value for a property, it will not appear in the response.
associations
A comma separated list of objects to retrieve associated IDs for. Any specified associations that don't exist will not be returned in the response. Learn more about the
associations API.
To retrieve a batch of specific leads by ID, make a
POST
request to
crm/v3/objects/leads/batch/read
. The batch endpoint
can't
retrieve associations. Learn how to batch read associations with the
associations API
.
For the batch read endpoint, you can use the optional
Property
parameter to retrieve leads by
leadID
or a custom
unique identifier property
. By default, the
id
values in the request refer to the record ID (
hs_object_id
), so the
idProperty
parameter isn't required when retrieving by record ID. If you're using a custom unique value property to retrieve leads, you must include the
idProperty
parameter.
Update contacts
You can update leads individually or in batches. For existing leads, the leads ID is a unique value, so you can use
leadsId
to update leads via the API.
To update an individual lead by its lead ID, make a
PATCH
request to
/crm/v3/objects/leads/{leadsId}
, and include the data you want to update in the request body.
Associate existing leads with records
To associate a lead with other CRM records or an activity, make a
PUT
request to
/crm/v3/objects/leads/{leadsId}/associations/{toObjectType}/{toObjectId}/{associationTypeId}
.
To retrieve the
associationTypeId
value, refer to
this list
of default values, or make a
GET
request to
/crm/v4/associations/{fromObjectType}/{toObjectType}/labels
.
Learn more about the
associations API.
Remove an association
To remove an association between a lead and a record or activity, make a
DELETE
request to the following URL:
/crm/v3/objects/leads/{leadsID}/associations/{toObjectType}/{toObjectId}/{associationTypeId}
.
If you remove all primary associations to the lead, the lead will automatically be deleted.
Delete leads
You can delete contacts individually or in batches, which will add the contact to the recycling bin in HubSpot. You can later
restore the contact within HubSpot
.
To delete an individual contact by its ID, make a
DELETE
request to
/crm/v3/objects/contacts/{contactId}
.
Learn more about batch deleting contacts on the
Endpoints
tab at the top of this article.
Limits
Batch operations for creating, updating, and archiving are limited to batches of 100.

Getting started overview
Whether you’re a new HubSpot developer or looking to expand your skills, this section will guide you through the process of getting up and running. You’ll explore the different development routes available, as well as the specific tooling and accounts you’ll need to achieve your goals.
The advantages of a connected platform
First, it’s helpful to consider what makes HubSpot a powerful platform for developers.
The foundation of every HubSpot account is the
CRM
(Customer Relationship Management) platform, a database of business relationships and processes. HubSpot offers different routes for external developers and partners to work with the CRM so they can create extra value for HubSpot end users. This includes:
Creating integrations and/or extensions with HubSpot’s APIs to sync data between HubSpot and external platforms.
Building custom websites using the HubSpot CMS (Content Management System). In addition to a full suite of content management tools, the CMS fully integrates with the CRM. This makes campaign launches, capturing leads and ongoing customer communications easier to manage.
Customizing the CRM with UI extensions. Developers can use React to build flexible custom cards that integrate seamlessly with HubSpot.
In the next section, you’ll get an overview of the tooling that’s available for HubSpot developers. Then, you'll choose a route to continue on your HubSpot developer journey.
1. Install tools to help you build
There are a wide range of tools available for HubSpot developers. The mix of tools you’ll need will depend on your specific goals.
HubSpot CLI:
installing the HubSpot CLI for local development is a great starting point for many development tasks. The CLI is used when building UI Extensions and CMS assets, and can be used to create and manage secrets, HubDB tables, and custom object data from your account. You'll need to have
Node.js
installed (version 18 or higher is required, and the LTS version is recommended). To install the CLI globally, run the following command:
Copy code snippet
npm i -g @hubspot/cli
npm
i
-g
@hubspot/cli
Visual studio code:
installing
Visual Studio Code
means you can take advantage of the
HubSpot Visual Studio Code extension
, which allows you to centralize your development workflow.
Client libraries
: HubSpot provides client libraries for
Node
,
PHP
,
Ruby
, and
Python
.
Postman:
use

Marketing Email
Marketing emails endpoint reference
If you have a
Marketing Hub
Professional
or
Enterprise
account, you can use the Marketing Emails API to programmatically create, update, and get details about marketing emails. You can also query details about the post-send statistics of a specific email or set of emails. These statistics should match what you can access in the app on the
Details
section of a particular email and will be returned under the stats object in your JSON response.
The Marketing Email API cannot be used to create or retrieve data for sales emails that are created and sent via the contact record. To get details for sales emails, use the Engagements API.
Please note:
To programmatically send transactional emails to contacts, use the
Single-send API
.
To use the
/publish
and
/unpublish
endpoints, you must have a
Marketing Hub
Enterprise
account or the
transactional email add-on
.
Create a marketing email
To create an email, make a
POST
request to
/marketing/v3/emails
and include the following fields in the body of your request:

business units API
.

To retrieve an individual email, make a
GET
request to
/marketing/v3/emails/{emailId}
To retrieve a list of all emails, make a
GET
request to
/marketing/v3/emails
, and include any filters as query parameters in your request (e.g., add

Automation API | Sequences API (BETA)
Sequences API (BETA)
Sequences endpoint reference
To send a series of targeted, timed email templates to nurture contacts over time, you can
create a sequence
. You can use the sequences tool to automatically create tasks to remind you to follow up with your contacts.
With the sequences API, you can:
Get a list of sequences
Get a specific sequence
Enroll a contact in a sequence
View a contact’s enrollment status
This could be useful if you have an app that maintains a list of contacts and you want to enroll them in a HubSpot sequence. With the sequences API, from your app, you could:
Get a list of sequences
Enroll a contact in a sequence
Review the enrollment status
The sections below provide a walkthrough of how to use the v4 endpoints. For a full reference of the available endpoints and their required fields, click the
Endpoints
tab at the top of this article.
Please note
: This API is currently in beta and is subject to change based on testing and feedback. By using these endpoints you agree to adhere to HubSpot's
Developer Terms
&
Developer Beta Terms
. You also acknowledge and understand the risk associated with testing an unstable API.
Fetch a sequence
To get details about a specific sequence in your account, make a
GET
request to
/automation/v4/sequences/{sequenceId}?userId={userId}
, where the sequenceId is the ID of an existing sequence in your account.
For example, to get details about a sequence that ID is
123456789
and your
user ID
is
2222222
, make a
GET
request to
/automation/v4/sequences/123456789?userId=2222222
. Use the ID of the specific sequence as the sequenceId in the request URL and use your userId as a query parameter.
The response for fetching a sequence would resemble the following:

Webhooks API
Webhooks
Webhooks endpoint reference
The Webhooks API allows you to subscribe to events happening in a HubSpot account with your integration installed. Rather than making an API call when an event happens in a connected account, HubSpot can send an HTTP request to an endpoint you configure. You can configure subscribed events in your app’s settings or using the endpoints detailed below. Webhooks can be more scalable than regularly polling for changes, especially for apps with a large install base.
Using the Webhooks API requires the following:
You must set up a HubSpot app to use webhooks by subscribing to the events you want to be notified about, and by specifying a URL to send those notifications. See the
prerequisites documentation
for more details about creating an app.
You must deploy a publicly available and secure (HTTPS) endpoint for that URL that can handle the webhook payloads specified in this documentation.
Webhooks are set up for a
HubSpot app
, not individual accounts. Any account that install your app by going through the
OAuth flow
will be subscribed to its webhook subscriptions.
You can subscribe to CRM object events, which includes contacts, companies, deals, tickets, products and line items, as well as conversations events.
Please note:
You can also
manage webhooks in a private app
. In private apps, webhook settings can only be edited in the in-app settings for your private app, and cannot currently be edited through the API.
To subscribe to conversations webhooks, you need access to the
conversations inbox and messages APIs
, which is currently
in beta
.
Scopes
In order to use webhooks to subscribe to CRM events, your app will need to be configured to authorize the
Required scopes
that corresponds to the CRM object type you want to subscribe to. For example, if you want to subscribe to contact events, you would need to request the
crm.objects.contacts.read
scope.
If you're creating subscriptions in the settings UI of your public app, you'll be prompted to add the required scope in the
Create new webhook subscriptions
panel before you finish creating your subscription.
If you're creating a subscription by making a
POST
request to the
/webhooks/v3/{appId}/subscriptions
endpoint, the response will include an error that will provide the name of the scope you'll need to configure in the settings UI of your public app.
If your app is already using webhooks, you won't be able to remove any scopes required by active webhook subscriptions without first pausing and removing the subscriptions.
You can review the scopes required for each webhook subscription type in the
table below.
Review the OAuth documentation for
more details about scopes
and
setting up the authorization URL
for your app.
Webhook settings
Before setting up your webhook subscriptions, you need to specify a URL to send those notifications to. Follow the instructions in the sections below to learn how to fully configure subscriptions for your app.
Please note:
Webhook settings can be cached for up to five minutes. When making changes to the webhook URL, concurrency limits, or subscription settings, it may take up to five minutes to see your changes go into effect.
HubSpot sets a concurrency limit of 10 requests when sending subscription event data associated with an account that installed your app. This concurrency limit is the maximum number of in-flight requests that HubSpot will attempt at a time. Each request can contain up to 100 events.
Manage settings in your developer account
You can manage your URL and event throttling limit in your app’s configuration page in your developer account:
In your developer account, navigate to your
App
dashboard.
Click the
name
of the app you want to set up webhooks for.
In the left sidebar menu, navigate to
Webhooks
.
In the
Target URL
field, enter the
URL
that HubSpot will make a POST request to when events trigger.
Use the
Event throttling
setting to adjust the maximum number of events HubSpot will attempt to send.
Click
Save
.
Manage settings via API
You can use the following endpoints and your
developer API key
to programmatically configure webhook settings for an app.
To view any webhook settings currently configured for an app, make a
GET
request to
webhooks/v3/{appId}/settings
.
You'll need to include the
app ID
in the request, which you can find below the name of the app in your
Apps
dashboard, or on the
Auth
tab in your app's settings.
The settings object contains the following fields:
Field
Description
webhookUrl
The URL that HubSpot will send webhook notifications to. This URL must be served over HTTPS.
maxConcurrentRequests
The concurrency limit for the webhook URL. This value must be a number greater than five.
To make edits to these settings, make a
PUT
request to
webhooks/v3/{appId}/settings
and include the following fields in the request body:
Field
Description
targetUrl
The publicly available URL for HubSpot to call where event payloads will be delivered.
throttling
Configure webhook throttling details in this object. The throttling object includes the
period
and
maxConcurrentRequests
fields.
period
Time scale for this setting. Can be either
SECONDLY
(per second) or
ROLLING_MINUTE
(per minute).
maxConcurrentRequests
The maximum number of HTTP requests HubSpot will attempt to make to your app in a given time frame determined by
period
.
For example, your request might look similar to the following:
Copy code snippet
// PUT request to https://api.hubapi.com/webhooks/v3/{appId}/settings
{
"throttling": {
"period": "SECONDLY",
"maxConcurrentRequests": 10
},
"targetUrl": "https://www.example.com/hubspot/target"
}

Webhook subscriptions
Once you’ve set up your webhook URL and event throttling limit, you’ll need to create one or more subscriptions. Webhook subscriptions tell HubSpot which events your particular app would like to receive.
Subscriptions apply to all customers who have installed your integration. This means that you only need to specify what subscriptions you need once. Once you've turned on a subscription for an application, it will automatically start getting webhooks for all customers that have installed your application, and your integration will start receiving webhook triggers from any new customers.
For all
associationChange
webhook subscriptions, the webhook will fire two events for both sides of the association.
When associating two contacts, a subscription to
contact.associationChange
will fire two events, representing
contact 1 to contact 2
and
contact 2 to contact 1
.
When associating a company, if you have two webhook subscriptions
contact.associationChange
and
company.associationChange
, you will receive two events. These will represent
contact 1 to company 1
and
company 1 to contact 1
.
The following subscription types are supported and can be used as the value for the
eventType
field when creating subscriptions via API:

.
Create subscriptions in your developer account
You can create webhook subscriptions in your HubSpot developer account.
In your HubSpot developer account, navigate to the
Apps
dashboard.
Click the
name
of an app.
In the left sidebar menu, navigate to
Webhooks
.
Click
Create subscription
.
In the right panel, click the
Which object types?
dropdown menu and select the
objects
you want to create a subscription for.
Click the
Listen for which events?
dropdown menu and select the
event types
.
If you're creating a subscription for property change events, click the
Which properties?
dropdown menu and select the
properties
to listen for.
Click
Subscribe
.
The subscription will appear in your webhooks settings. New subscriptions are created in a paused state, so you will need to activate the subscription for webhooks to send:
In the
Event subscriptions
section, hover over the object type and click
View subscriptions
.
Select the
checkbox
next to the event, then in the table header click
Activate
.
Create subscriptions via API
You can programmatically create subscriptions using the following endpoints. You will need to use your developer API key when making requests to these endpoints.
A subscription object can include the following fields:
Field
Description
id
A number representing the unique ID of a subscription.
createdAt
The time in milliseconds when this subscription was created.
createdBy
The user ID associated with the user who created the subscription.
active
This indicates whether or not the subscription is turned on and actively triggering notifications. The value can be
true
or
false
.
eventType
The type of subscription. The
table
at the start of this section includes the available subscription types.
propertyName
The name of the property the subscription will listen for changes to. This is only needed for property change subscription types.
Get subscriptions
To retrieve the list of subscriptions, make a
GET
request to
webhooks/v3/{appId}/subscriptions
.
The response will be an array of objects representing your subscriptions. Each object will include information on the subscription like the ID, create date, type, and whether or not it’s currently active. Here’s what an example response would look like:
Copy code snippet
// Example GET request to https://api.hubapi.com/webhooks/v3/{appId}/subscriptions

Create a new subscription
To create a new subscription, make a
POST
request to
webhooks/v3/{appId}/subscriptions
.
In the request body, you can include the following fields:
Field
Description
eventType
The type of subscription.
propertyName
The name of the property the subscription will listen for changes to. This is only needed for property change subscription types.
active
This indicates whether or not the subscription is turned on and actively triggering notifications. The value can be
true
or
false
.
You don't need to include
id
,
createdAt
, or
createdBy
, as those fields are set automatically.
For example, your request body may appear similar to the following:
Copy code snippet
// Example POST request to https://api.hubapi.com/webhooks/v3/{appId}/subscriptions
{
"eventType": "company.propertyChange",
"propertyName": "companyname",
"active": false
}

"eventType"
:
"company.propertyChange"
,
5
"propertyName"
:
"companyname"
,
6
"active"
:

}
The
eventType
must be a valid subscription type as defined in the above section and the
propertyName
must be a valid property name. If a customer has no property defined that matches this value, then this subscription will not result in any notifications.
Update a subscription
To activate or pause a subscription, make a
PUT
request to
webhooks/v3/{appId}/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}
.
In the request body, include the following:
Field

true
or
false
.
Delete a subscription
To delete a subscription, make a
DELETE
request to
webhooks/v3/{appId}/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}
.
Webhook payloads
The endpoint at the target URL that you specify in your app's webhooks settings will receive
POST
requests containing JSON formatted data from HubSpot.
To ensure that the requests you're getting at your webhook endpoint are actually coming from HubSpot, HubSpot populates a
X-HubSpot-Signature
header with a SHA-256 hash built using the client secret of your app combined with details of the request. Learn more about
validating request signatures
.
Use the tables below to view details about fields that may be contained in the payload.
Field
Description
objectId
The ID of the object that was created, changed, or deleted. For contacts this is the contact ID; for companies, the company ID; for deals, the deal ID; and for conversations the
thread ID
.
propertyName
This is only sent for property change subscriptions and is the name of the property that was changed.
propertyValue
This is only sent for property change subscriptions and represents the new value set for the property that triggered the notification.

When this event occurred as a millisecond timestamp.
eventType
The type of event this notification is for. Review the list of supported subscription types in the webhooks subscription section above.
attemptNumber
Starting at 0, which number attempt this is to notify your service of this event. If your service times-out or throws an error as describe in the
Retries
section below, HubSpot will attempt to send the notification again.
messageId
This is only sent when a webhook is listening for new messages to a thread. It is the ID of the new message.
messageType
This is only sent when a webhook is listening for new messages to a thread. It represents the type of message you're sending. This value can either be
MESSAGE
or
COMMENT
.
Field
Description
primaryObjectId
The ID of the merge winner, which is the record that remains after the merge. In the HubSpot merge UI, this is the record on the right.
mergedObjectIds
An array of IDs that represent the records that are merged into the merge winner. In the HubSpot merge UI, this is the record on the left.
newObjectId
The ID of the record that is created as a result of the merge. This is separate from
primaryObjectId
because in some cases a new record is created as a result of the merge.
numberOfPropertiesMoved
An integer representing how many properties were transferred during the merge.
Field
Description
associationType
The type of association, which will be one of the following:
CONTACT_TO_COMPANY

fromObjectId
The ID of the record that the association change was made from.
toObjectId
The ID of the secondary record in the association event.
associationRemoved
A boolean that represents the following:
true
: the webhook was triggered by removing an association.
false
: the webhook was triggered by creating an association.
isPrimaryAssociation
A boolean that represents the following:
true
: the secondary record is the
primary association
of the record that the association change was made from.
false
: the record is
not
the primary association of the record that the association change was made from.
Please note:
creating a primary association instance between two object records will cause the corresponding non-primary association to also be created. This may result in two webhook messages.

As shown above, you should expect to receive an array of objects in a single request. The batch size can vary, but will be under 100 notifications. HubSpot will send multiple notifications when a lot of events have occurred within a short period of time. For example, if you've subscribed to new contacts and a customer imports a large number of contacts, HubSpot will send you the notifications for these imported contacts in batches and not one per request.
HubSpot does not guarantee that you'll receive these notifications in the order they occurred. Use the
occurredAt
property for each notification to determine when the event that triggered the notification occurred.
HubSpot also does not guarantee that you'll only get a single notification for an event. Though this should be rare, it is possible that HubSpot will send you the same notification multiple times.
Privacy compliant contact deletions
HubSpot users have the ability to permanently delete a contact record to comply with privacy laws. Learn more about performing a
GDPR compliant delete
.
You can subscribe to the
contact.privacyDeletion
subscription type to receive webhook notifications when a user performs a privacy compliant contact deletion.
Privacy deletion notifications have some special behavior:
A privacy deletion event will also trigger the contact deletion event, so you will receive two notifications if you are subscribed to both events.
These notifications will not necessarily be sent in any specific order or in the same batch of messages. You will need to use the object ID to match the separate messages.
Security
To ensure that the requests you're getting at your webhook endpoint are actually coming from HubSpot, HubSpot populates a
X-HubSpot-Signature
header with a SHA-256 hash of the concatenation of the app-secret for your application and the request body HubSpot is sending.
To verify this signature, concatenate the app secret of your application and the un-parsed request body of the request you're handling, and get a SHA-256 hash of the result. Compare the resulting hash with the value of the
X-HubSpot-Signature
. If these values match, then this verifies that this request came from HubSpot. Or, the request came from someone else who knows your application secret. It's important to keep this value secret.
If these values do not match, then this request may have been tampered with in-transit or someone may be spoofing webhook notifications to your endpoint.
Learn more about
validating signature requests
.
Retries
If your service has problems handling notifications at any time, HubSpot will attempt to re-send failed notifications up to 10 times.
HubSpot will retry in the following cases:
Connection failed:
HubSpot cannot open an HTTP connection to the provided webhook URL.
Timeout:
your service takes longer than five seconds to send back a response to a batch of notifications.
Error codes:
your service responds with any HTTP status code (4xx or 5xx).
Notifications will be retried up to 10 times. These retries will be spread out over the next 24 hours, with varying delays between requests. Individual notifications will have some randomization applied, to prevent a large number of concurrent failures from being retried at the exact same time.
Limits
POST
requests that HubSpot sends to your service via your webhook subscriptions will
not
count against your
app's API rate limits
.
You can create a maximum of 1000 subscriptions per application. If you attempt to create more you will receive a 400 bad request in return with the following body:
Copy code snippet
//
{
"status": "error",
"message": "Couldn't create another subscription. You've reached the maximum number allowed per application (1000).",

Once the listings are translated, any edits made in the primary listing will
not
automatically update in the translated listings. To update an auto translated listing:
Delete the existing translated listing and then create translated listing again in the same languages. When creating a new listing, changes from the primary listing will be pulled in.
You can also manually update the translated listing. However, manual changes will go through the review process and has to be approved by HubSpot admins before being published.
Click the
Language for this listing
dropdown menu and select the
language
you want to create this listing in.
When a user has set the language in their account, then they will automatically see the listing in that same language. For example, if you've create a listing in Spanish, and a user has set Spanish as their
account's default language
, the listing will appear to the user in Spanish.
If the
Auto translate
option has been turned on, the languages selected will be auto translated and published as new listings.
Click
Create
. If you're manually creating a listing, follow the steps to create and submit a listing in the selected language.
Please note:

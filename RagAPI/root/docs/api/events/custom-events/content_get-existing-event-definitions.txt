Custom events enable you to define and track events that are unique to your business, such as events on your site or in an app. You can configure events to store information within properties, which you can then use across HubSpot's tools.
To send
custom event
data to HubSpot, you first need to define the event. This is similar to custom CRM objects, where you first need to define the custom object before you can create individual records for that object. An event definition includes details such as its metadata, CRM object associations, and properties.
Below, learn more about creating and managing event definitions using the API. To learn how to create event definitions without using the API, check out
HubSpot's Knowledge Base
.
Create an event definition
To create the custom event schema, make a
POST
request to
events/v3/event-definitions
. In the request body, include definitions for your event schema, including its label, name, CRM object associations, and custom properties.
Below is an example request body along with parameter definitions. For a full example, view the
custom event example below
.
label
string
(required)
The event's human readable label, which will display in HubSpot (up to 100 characters). Long labels may be cut off in certain parts of HubSpot's UI.
name
string
The unique, internal name of the event, which you'll use to reference the event through the API. If no value is provided, HubSpot will automatically generate one based on the
label
. This property
cannot
be changed after the event definition is created.
Note the following naming requirements:
This property can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens (up to 50 characters).
The first character must be a letter.
description
string
The event's description, which will display in HubSpot.
primaryObject
string
The CRM object that the event will be associated with. Event completions will display on CRM record timelines of the specified object. Can be one of
CONTACT
,
COMPANY
,
DEAL
,
TICKET
or
CUSTOM OBJECT NAME
.
If no value is provided, HubSpot will automatically associate the event with contacts. This
cannot
be changed after the event definition is created.
propertyDefinitions
array
For each custom event definition, HubSpot provides a set of default properties that you can use when sending event data. Include this array to define any custom properties that your event needs outside of those default properties. You can include up to 50 custom properties per event.
For each property, include:
label
: the property's in-app label.
name
: the property's internal name, which you'll use when sending property data through the API.
type
: the
type of property
. Default is
string
.
options
: for
enumeration
properties, the array of pre-defined values, including a
label
and
value
for each.
description
: optional text to describe the property.

Event properties
Custom event properties are used to store information on individual custom event completions. These properties should be used when appropriate for sending event completions, but they are not required for an event completion to be valid. For each event definition, HubSpot provides a default set of 32 properties. In addition, You can create up to 50 custom properties per event definition.
Properties can be of the following types:
string
: a property that receives plain text strings. If the property name contains the words
url
,
referrer
, or
link
, the property value can be up to 1024 characters. Otherwise, property values can be up to 256 characters.
number
: a property that receives numeric values with up to one decimal.
enumeration
: A property with pre-defined options. When creating this property type, include an
options
array to set the available values.
datetime
: A property that receives epoch millisecond or ISO8601 values representing a timestamp.

define new properties for existing events

Copy code snippet
//
{
"name": "property-name",

When naming your property, keep the following in mind:
Once you create a property, the property’s name cannot be changed.
The name can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens.
The first character of the property name must be a letter.
The property name and label can each be up to 50 characters long.
If an property name is not provided, one will be auto-generated using the property label.
Long labels may be cut off in certain parts of the HubSpot UI.
Update existing custom properties
To update an existing property on a custom event, make a
PATCH
request to
events/v3/event-definitions/{eventName}/property
. The only fields that can be updated on a property are the
label
,
description
, and
options
for enumeration properties.
Please note:
to change the type of property, use the
DELETE
endpoint to delete the property and recreate it with the correct type.
Delete a property
To delete an existing property on a custom event, make a
DELETE
request to
events/v3/event-definitions/{eventName}/property/{propertyName}
.
When a property is deleted, it will no longer be available for use in future event completions. Past completions will still have the property values.
Please note:
when deleting an event:
All of the events for that event definition will be deleted and unrecoverable.
Previously deleted
eventName
's cannot be used again.
Update an event
The only fields that can be updated on an event definition are the
label
and
description
.
To update an existing custom event schema, make a
PATCH
request to
events/v3/event-definitions/{eventName}
.
Delete an event
When you delete a custom event, references to that event in other HubSpot tools, such as workflows and reports, will no longer use the event.
To delete a custom event, make a
DELETE
request to
events/v3/event-definitions/{eventName}
.
Get existing event definitions
To fetch a single event definition, make a
GET
request to
events/v3/event-definitions/{eventName}
.
To search event definitions by specific criteria, make a
GET
request to
events/v3/event-definitions
. You can supply the following query parameters to refine your search:
searchString
: searches for events that contain the specified characters in the
name
field. Searching is
not
fuzzy, but is instead a naive
contains
search.
after
: a hashed string provided in paged responses for viewing the next page of search results.
limit
: the maximum number of results to return.
includeProperties
: a boolean value that specifies whether to include event properties in the returned results.
Custom event example
The following is a walkthrough of creating an example custom event.
This walkthrough covers:
creating a custom event definition.
creating a new property on the event definition.
Goal:
a car dealership called CarSpot has an online inventory of all cars available on their lot. CarSpot wants to track when visitors to their site view a specific car available on their lot. To do so, they'll create a custom event, which they'll associate with contact records to track who views the listing. This event will also need a set of custom properties to store the car listing details viewed during each event.
Create custom event definition
Having decided what to call the event, what properties they'd like to include with each triggered event, and the CRM object they want to associate events with, they'll create the event schema by making a
POST
request to
/events/v3/event-definitions
with the following request body:
Copy code snippet
///Example request body for event definitions
{
"label": "Viewed Car",
"name": "viewed_car",
"description": "An event that fires when visitor views a car listing in the online inventory",
"primaryObject": "CONTACT",
"propertyDefinitions": [
{
"name": "condition",
"label": "Condition",
"type": "enumeration",
"options": [
{
"label": "New",
"value": "new"
},
{
"label": "Used",
"value": "used"
}
]
},
{
"name": "year",
"label": "Year",
"type": "number"
},
{
"name": "make",
"label": "Make",
"type": "string"
},
{
"name": "model",
"label": "Model",
"type": "string"
},
{
"name": "mileage",
"label": "Mileage",
"type": "number"
}
]
}

}

]
45
}
Create property on custom event definition
Just after implementing the event on their website, CarSpot decided that they want to see if listing price will influence click rate. To track this, they'll create a new property containing the price of the listing.
To define a new property, they'll make a
POST
request to
/events/v3/event-definitions/viewed_car/property
with the following request body:
Copy code snippet
///Example request body for creating a property
{
"name": "price",
"label": "Price",
"type": "number"
}
xxxxxxxxxx

///Example request body for creating a property

{
3
"name"
:
"price"
,
4
"label"
:
"Price"
,
5
"type"
:
"number"
6
}
With their custom event defined, they can now
send event data to HubSpot using this custom event definition
.

Event Analytics
Event analytics endpoint reference
Use the event analytics API to fetch events associated with CRM records of any type (
Marketing Hub
Enterprise
,
Sales Hub
Enterprise
,
Service Hub
Enterprise
, or
CMS Hub
Enterprise
only). This includes standard events, such as website page views and email opens, as well as
custom events
.
For example, use this API to view a timeline of the interactions that a contact has had with your content. You can then use this timeline to build a dataset for custom analytics or present a contact timeline in an external application.
Query individual event completions
This API returns events for one CRM record at a time. You can select the record by specifying the
objectType
and including either the
objectId
or
objectProperty
query parameter.
Select by object ID
To specify a record by its ID, add the
objectId
query parameter. For example, to specify a contact record with the ID of
2832
, you would make the following
GET
request:
/events/v3/events/?objectType=contact&objectId=224834
Select by object property
To specify a record by a unique property instead of contact ID, add the
objectProperty
parameter. Reference the property by including the property name and the value in the following format:
objectProperty.{propname}={propvalue}
For example, to specify a contact by their email address, you would make the following
GET
request:
/events/v3/events/?objectType=contact&objectProperty.email=user12@dev.com
Querying and filtering for event types
When querying for the events associated with a given CRM object, the response will include all event types, including custom behavioral events.
To only return event completions for a specific event type, you can include an
eventType
parameter, followed by the event name. To get a list of all available event types, you can make a
GET
request to
/events/v3/events/event-types
. The response will return all event types in your account. You can then use one of these event names as a query parameter in a
GET
request to the
/events/v3/events
endpoint.
For example:
/events/v3/events/eventType={EVENT_NAME}&objectType=contact&objectId=224834

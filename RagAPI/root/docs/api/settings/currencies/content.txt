Settings API | Currencies
Currencies
With the currencies API, you can manage the currencies used in your HubSpot account, including setting your account's company currency, creating additional currencies, and updating currency exchange rates. Learn more about
adding and editing currencies within HubSpot.
Supported currencies
Only certain currencies are supported for use in HubSpot. To retrieve a list of HubSpot's supported currencies and their codes, make a
GET
request to
/settings/v3/currencies/codes
.
You can use any of the returned codes as values for the
currencyCode
,
fromCurrencyCode
, and
toCurrencyCode
properties.
Add account currencies and set exchange rates
Depending on your HubSpot subscription, you can add additional currencies for use in your account, and set their exchange rates compared to your company currency. Learn more about the number of currencies you can have in your account in the
HubSpot Product & Services Catalog.
To add a currency and set the exchange rate, or add a new exchange rate for an existing currency, make a
POST
request to
/settings/v3/currencies/exchange-rates
. In your request, the following fields are required:
fromCurrencyCode
: the currency code of the currency you want to add to your account. This must be one of HubSpot's supported currency codes.
conversionRate
: the exchange rate from the additional currency to your company currency. The value must be greater than 0 and can contain up to 6 decimal values (e.g.,
1.36
). Any values with more than 6 decimal places will be rounded (e.g.,
1.2345678
becomes
1.234568
).
You can also include a timestamp using the following field:
effectiveAt
: the date and time the exchange rate takes effect. Values can be in either
long date
or
ISO 8601
format.
For example, your request may look like:
Copy code snippet
///Example request
{
"fromCurrencyCode": "EUR",
"conversionRate": "1.3",
"effectiveAt": "2023-05-08T14:59:19.813Z"
}

///Example request
2
{
3
"fromCurrencyCode"
:
"EUR"
,
4
"conversionRate"
:
"1.3"
,
5
"effectiveAt"
:
"2023-05-08T14:59:19.813Z"
6
}
To add multiple currencies and set their exchange rates in bulk, make a
POST
request to
/settings/v3/currencies/exchange-rates​/batch​/create
. Your request must include the
fromCurrencyCode
and
conversionRate
properties for each currency.
For example, your request may look like:
Copy code snippet
///Example request body
{
"inputs": [
{
"fromCurrencyCode": "USD",
"conversionRate": 2.7
},
{ "fromCurrencyCode": "EUR", "conversionRate": 1.3 }
]
}

Retrieve account currencies and exchange rates
You can view your account's current and historical currencies and exchange rates.
To view your account's company currency, make a
GET
request to
/settings/v3/currencies/company-currency
. To view all of your account's current currencies and exchange rates, make a
GET
request to
/settings/v3/currencies/exchange-rates/current
. When you make a successful request, the response will include the IDs of the exchange rates set in your account.
To view a specific currency and its exchange rate, make a
GET
request to
/settings/v3/currencies/exchange-rates/{exchangeRateId}
.
To view all of your account's currencies and exchange rates, including historical currencies, make a
GET
request to
/settings/v3/currencies/exchange-rates
. You can filter which currencies and exchange rates are returned using the
limit
,
after
,
fromCurrencyCode
and
toCurrencyCode
query parameters in your request.
Update your account's company currency
Your account's
company currency
is the currency used in deal amount totals, deal reports, and when creating new deals in HubSpot.
To update your account's company currency, make a
PUT
request to
/settings/v3/currencies/company-currency
. In your request, include the
currencyCode
value for the currency you want to set as your company currency. For example, your request may look like:
Copy code snippet
///Example request body
{
"currencyCode": "AED"
}
xxxxxxxxxx
4
1
///Example request body
2
{
3
"currencyCode"
:
"AED"
4
}
Please note
: for accounts with multiple currencies, the company currency will have an automatically generated self-referencing rate (e.g., EUR/EUR=1.0). This rate is
not
modifiable via API.
Update currency exchange rates
Once currencies are set up in your HubSpot account, you can update their exchange rates. To update an individual exchange rate, make a
PATCH
request to
/settings/v3/currencies/exchange-rates/{exchangeRateId}
. In your request, include the new exchange rate in the
conversionRate
property. Your request may look like:
Copy code snippet
///Example request body
{
"conversionRate": 2
}
xxxxxxxxxx
4
1
///Example request body
2
{
3
"conversionRate"
:
2
4
}
To update multiple currencies, make a
POST
request to
/settings/v3/currencies/exchange-rates/batch/update
. In your request, include the exchange rate IDs and the new
conversionRate
values. For example:
Copy code snippet
///Example request body
{
"inputs": [
{
"id": "string",
"conversionRate": 1.3
},
{
"id": "string",
"conversionRate": 2
}
]
}

Hide a currency
You can hide a currency so that it's not visible in your HubSpot account. To hide an existing account currency, make a

. In your request, include the following:
fromCurrencyCode
: the code of the currency you want to hide or show.
toCurrencyCode
: the code of your company currency.
visibleInUI
: whether or not the currency and its exchange rate are shown in your HubSpot account. To hide a currency, the value should be

To hide a currency, your request may look like:
Copy code snippet
///Example request body
{
"fromCurrencyCode": "USD",
"toCurrencyCode": "AED",
"visibleInUI": false
}
xxxxxxxxxx

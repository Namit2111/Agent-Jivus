API usage guidelines
HubSpot closely monitors usage of our public APIs to ensure a quality experience for every user. All app and integration developers must comply with the
HubSpot Acceptable Use Policy
and
API Terms
. While HubSpot reserves the right to change or deprecate the APIs over time, updates will always be provided in advance through the
Developer Changelog
.
Authentication and security
For optimal security, all apps must use HubSpot’s
OAuth protocol
directly, or use your app's access token if you're building a
private app
. Apps are responsible for storing time-to-live (TTL) data and refreshing user access tokens in accordance with this protocol. When an access token is generated, it will include an
expires_in
parameter indicating how long it can be used to make API calls before refreshing.
Unauthorized (401)
requests are not a valid indicator that a new access token must be retrieved.
Checking API usage
Private apps
To view API usage for a private app:
In your HubSpot account, click the
settings icon
in the main navigation bar.
In the left sidebar menu, navigate to
Integrations
>
Private Apps
.
Click the
name
of the private app.
On the app details page, click the
Logs
tab.
Review the API calls listed in the table. You can also use the
search bar
,
filters
, and
date pickers
to further refine the displayed API calls.
Learn more about
checking API usage in private apps
.
Public apps using OAuth
To view API usage for a public app using OAuth:
In your developer account, navigate to
Apps
in the main navigation bar.
Click the
name
of the app.
In the left sidebar menu, navigate to
Monitoring
.
Use the
tabs
to view different types of requests being made to or from the app. While viewing these logs, you can click an
individual request
to view more information.

monitoring API usage for public apps
.
Rate Limits
Public apps
For OAuth apps, each HubSpot account that installs your app is limited to 110 requests every 10 seconds. This excludes the
Search API
, as noted in the
Other Limits
section below. Limits related to the
API limit increase
don't apply.
Private apps
The number of calls your private app can make is based on your account subscription and whether you've purchased the
API limit increase
:
Product Tier
Per 10 Seconds
Per Day
Private Apps
(Any Hub)
Free and Starter
100 / private app
250,000 / account
(Any Hub)
Professional
190 / private app
625,000 / account
(Any Hub)
Enterprise
190 / private app
1,000,000 / account
Private Apps with
API Limit Increase
(Any Hub)
Free, Starter, Professional, and Enterprise
250 / private app
1,000,000 / account on top of your base subscription, for each limit increase. You can purchase a maximum of two API limit increases.
Please note:
purchasing an API Limit Increase will increase the maximum number of requests you can make to the
associations API
to 1,000,000 daily requests and 200 requests per 10 seconds, but these limits
cannot
be increased further with an additional API Limit Increase purchase.
Other limits
You can create up to 100 apps per developer account.
You can create up to 20 private apps per HubSpot account.
You can create up to 1,000 webhook subscriptions per app.
You can create up to 25 CRM extension settings per app.
You can create up to 750 timeline event types per app.
You can create up to 500 properties per timeline event type.
Request limits
Keep the following general limits in mind when making requests to HubSpot's API endpoints. Some APIs may also have their own, more specific limits which will be listed on the API reference page under
Limits
.
The
search API
endpoints are rate limited to
five
requests per second per authentication token, and 200 records per page request. Learn more about
search limits
.
API requests that are exempt from daily or secondary limits will
not
be logged in HubSpot. If you want to store these exempted requests, you'll need to log these requests externally.
Batch requests to CRM object endpoints are limited to 100 records per request. For example, you can't batch read more than 100 contacts per request.
Service Limits

here
.
Error Responses
Any app or integration exceeding its rate limits will receive a
429
error response for all subsequent API calls. Requests resulting in an error response shouldn’t exceed 5% of your total daily requests. If you plan on listing your app in the
HubSpot App Marketplace
, it must stay under this 5% limit to be certified.
The
429
response will have the following format:
Copy code snippet
//Example
{
"status": "error",
"message": "You have reached your daily limit.",
"errorType": "RATE_LIMIT",
"correlationId": "c033cdaa-2c40-4a64-ae48-b4cec88dad24",
"policyName": "DAILY",
"requestId": "3d3e35b7-0dae-4b9f-a6e3-9c230cbcf8dd"
}
1
//Example
2
{
3
"status"
:
"error"
,
4
"message"
:
"You have reached your daily limit."
,
5
"errorType"
:
"RATE_LIMIT"
,
6
"correlationId"
:
"c033cdaa-2c40-4a64-ae48-b4cec88dad24"
,
7
"policyName"
:
"DAILY"
,
8
"requestId"
:
"3d3e35b7-0dae-4b9f-a6e3-9c230cbcf8dd"
9
}
The
message
and
policyName
will indicate which limit you hit (either daily or secondly).
The
daily
limit resets at midnight based on your
time zone setting
.
The following table details the rate limit headers included in the response of each API request to HubSpot, subject to the exceptions listed below the table.
Header
Description
X-HubSpot-RateLimit-Daily
The number of API requests that are allowed per day. Note that this header is not included in the response to API requests authorized using
OAuth
.
X-HubSpot-RateLimit-Daily-Remaining
The number of API requests still allowed for the current day. Note that this header is not included in the response to API requests authorized using
OAuth
.
X-HubSpot-RateLimit-Interval-Milliseconds
The window of time that the
X-HubSpot-RateLimit-Max
and
X-HubSpot-RateLimit-Remaining
headers apply to.For example, a value of 10000 would be a window of 10 seconds.
X-HubSpot-RateLimit-Max
The number of requests allowed in the window specified in
X-HubSpot-RateLimit-Interval-Milliseconds
.For example, if this header had a value of 100, and the
X-HubSpot-RateLimit-Interval-Milliseconds
header was 10000, the enforced limit would be 100 requests per 10 seconds.
X-HubSpot-RateLimit-Remaining
The number of API requests still allowed for the window specified in
X-HubSpot-RateLimit-Interval-Milliseconds
Please note:
The
X-HubSpot-RateLimit-Secondly
and
X-HubSpot-RateLimit-Secondly-Remaining
headers are still included and will still have accurate data, but the limit referenced by these headers is no longer enforced and these two headers should be considered deprecated.
Responses from the
search API endpoints
will
not
include any of the rate limit headers listed above.
You can also check the number of calls used during the current day using
this endpoint
.
If you're running into the
TEN_SECONDLY_ROLLING
limit, you should throttle the requests that your app is making to stay under that limit. In addition to throttling the requests, or if you're running into the daily limit, check out the suggestions below.
If you find that you're still hitting the call limits after looking through these suggestions, please post on HubSpot's
developer forums
. You should include as many details as possible about the APIs you're using, how you're using them, and which limit you're hitting.
Use batch APIs and cache results when possible
If your site or app uses data from HubSpot on each page load, that data should be cached and loaded from that cache instead of being requested from the HubSpot APIs each time. If you're making repeated calls to get settings from your account for a batch job (such as getting your object properties, owners, or settings for a form), those settings should also be cached when possible.
Use webhooks to get updated data from HubSpot
If you have a HubSpot Marketing Enterprise subscription, you can use webhook actions in workflows to have data for contact records sent to your system. Webhooks can be triggered as an action in any workflow, so you can use any workflow
starting conditions
as the criteria to have contact data sent to your system. More details about using webhooks can be found
here
and example webhooks data is
here
. Webhook calls made via workflows do not count towards the API rate limit.

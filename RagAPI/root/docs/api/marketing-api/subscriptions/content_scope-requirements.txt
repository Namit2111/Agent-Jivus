Marketing API | Subscriptions v4
Subscriptions v4 API
Subscriptions endpoint reference
Subscription types represent the lawful basis to communicate with your contacts through email. Contacts can
manage their email preferences
so they're only opted in to emails they want to receive. The v4 subscriptions APIs allow you to programmatically subscribe or unsubscribe contacts from your email subscription types, or unsubscribe a contact from all email communication. These APIs also provide support for
business units
.
Scope requirements
The following scopes are required to use the v4 subscription API endpoints, based on the endpoint you're using:
communication_preferences.read
: provides access to fetch subscription type definitions and subscription preferences for a contact.
communication_preferences.write
: provides access to update subscription preferences for a contact.
communication_preferences.read_write
: provides access to both fetch and update subscription preferences for a contact and fetch all subscription definitions in your account.
communication_preferences.statuses.batch.read
: provides access to fetch subscription statuses in bulk.
communication_preferences.statuses.batch.write
: provides access to manage and update subscription statuses in bulk.
For a full list of available endpoints and example requests and responses, click the
Endpoints
tab at the top of this article.
Get all subscription types
To get a list of all email subscription types in your account, make a
GET
request to
/communication-preferences/v4/definitions
.
If you have the
Business Units add-on
, you can filter subscription types by business unit by including the
businessUnitId
as a query parameter in your request. The default
Account
business unit ID will always use
"businessUnitId": 0
.
The subscription types will be returned within the
results
field of the response.

If you have the Business Units add-on, the contact will be unsubscribed from all email from the business unit specified in your request, but will still be eligible to receive email from other business units in your account.

Payments
Payments endpoint reference
Use the payments API to fetch information about an account's
payments
. This is a read-only API, so it cannot be used for creating new or managing existing payments.
For example, use this API to
fetch all refunded payments
in an account.
Requirements
To use this API, the account must be set up to collect payments through either
HubSpot payments
or
Stripe payment processing
.
Retrieve payments
Depending on the information you need, there are a few ways to retrieve payments:
To retrieve all payments, make a
GET
request to
crm/v3/objects/commerce_payments
.
To retrieve a payment, make a
GET
request to the above URL and specify an payment ID. For example:
crm/v3/objects/commerce_payments/44446244097
.
To retrieve payments that meet a specific set of criteria, you can make a
POST
request to the search endpoint and include filters in the request body. See an example of using the
search endpoint below
.
The response will include a few default properties, including the create date, last modified date.

Properties
To return specific properties, include a
properties
query parameter in the request URL along with comma-separated property names. For example, making a
GET
request to the following URL would result in the response below:
crm/v3/objects/commerce_payments?properties=hs_customer_email,hs_latest_status
Copy code snippet
// Example response
{
"id": "40744976671",
"properties": {

To view all available payment properties, make a

. Learn more about using the

.
Below are some common payment properties that you may want to query.

Search for payments by properties
You can use the search endpoint to retrieve payments that meet a specific set of
filter criteria
. This will be a
POST
request that includes your filter criteria in the request body.
For example, to search for all refunded payments, you would make a
POST
request to
crm/v3/objects/commerce_payments/search
with the following request body:
Copy code snippet
// Example search request body
{
"filterGroups": [
{
"filters": [
{
"propertyName": "hs_latest_status",
"value": "refunded",
"operator": "EQ"
}
]
}
],
"properties": ["hs_latest_status", "hs_customer_email"]
}

]
12
}
13
],
14
"properties"
: [
"hs_latest_status"
,
"hs_customer_email"
]
15
}
Note that the
filters
array specifies the search criteria, while the
properties
array specifies which properties to return.
Associations
While you cannot set associations using this API, you can retrieve association information by making a GET request to the following URL:
crm/v3/objects/commerce_payments/{hs_object_id}/associations/{associatedObjectName}
Associated objects can include
contacts
,
companies
,
deals
,
invoices
,
quotes
,
line items
,
subscriptions
,
discounts
,
fees
, and
taxes
. These associates are based on the associations set on the invoice, payment link, or quote used for transaction. To manage these associations, you can
update the payment in HubSpot
.
Below is an example of how you might use this API combined with another API to get a specific set of association information.
Please note:
when retrieving line items from different objects created in HubSpot, you should expect to receive different IDs. This is because line items should only be associated with one object, which HubSpot handles automatically by creating copies of line items rather than using the same line item across multiple objects.
Retrieving a payment with associated contact
To retrieve a payment and contact associated with it, make a
GET
request to:
crm/v3/objects/commerce_payments/{hs_object_id}/associations/contact
This will return the IDs of the currently associated contact, along with meta information about the association type.
Copy code snippet
// Example response
{
"results": [
{
"id": "301",
"type": "commerce_payment_to_contact"
}
]
}
xxxxxxxxxx

// Example response

{

"results"

{

"id"
:
"301"
,
6
"type"
:
"commerce_payment_to_contact"
7
}
8
]
9
}
You can then use the returned IDs to request more information about the line items through the
contacts API
. For example, you could retrieve the contact using its ID by making a
GET
request to
crm/v3/objects/contacts/{contactId}
Copy code snippet
// Example response
{
"id": "301",
"properties": {
"createdate": "2022-09-27T13:13:31.004Z",
"email": "tom.bombadil@oldforest.com",
"firstname": "Tom",
"hs_object_id": "301",
"lastmodifieddate": "2023-11- 07T17:14:00.841Z",
"lastname": "Bombadil"
},
"createdAt": "2022-09-27T13:13:31.004Z",
"updatedAt": "2023-11-07T17:14:00.841Z",
"archived": false
}

CRM API | Invoices
Invoices
Invoices endpoint reference
Use the invoices API to fetch information about an account's
invoices
. This is a read-only API, so it cannot be used for creating new or managing existing invoices.
For example, use this API to
fetch all currently open invoices
.
Retrieve invoices
Depending on the information you need, there are a few ways to retrieve invoices:
To retrieve all invoices, make a
GET
request to
crm/v3/objects/invoices
.
To retrieve a specific invoice, make a
GET
request to the above URL and specify an invoice ID. For example:
crm/v3/objects/invoices/44446244097
.
To retrieve invoices that meet a specific set of criteria, you can make a
POST
request to the search endpoint and include filters in the request body. See an example of using the
search endpoint below
.
The response will include a few default properties, including the create date, last modified date.

Properties
To return specific properties, include a
properties
query parameter in the request URL along with comma-separated property names. For example, making a
GET
request to the following URL would result in the response below:
crm/v3/objects/invoices?properties=hs_invoice_status,hs_amount_billed
Copy code snippet

{
"id": "44446244097",

To view all available invoice properties, make a
GET
request to
crm/v3/properties/invoices
. Learn more about using the
properties API
.
Below are some common invoice properties that you may want to query.
Property name
Label in UI

hs_due_date

Search for invoices by properties
You can use the search
endpoint
to retrieve invoices that meet a specific set of
filter criteria
. This will be a
POST
request that includes your filter criteria in the request body.
For example, to search for all open invoices, you would make a
POST
request to
crm/v3/objects/invoices/search
with the following request body:
Copy code snippet
// Example search request body
{
"filterGroups": [
{
"filters": [
{
"propertyName": "hs_invoice_status",
"value": "open",
"operator": "EQ"
}
]
}
],
"properties": ["hs_invoice_status", "hs_due_date"]
}

{

"hs_invoice_status"
,

,

"operator"
:

10
}
11
]
12
}
13
],
14
"properties"
: [
"hs_invoice_status"
,
"hs_due_date"
]
15
}
Note that the
filters
array specifies the search criteria, while the
properties
array specifies which properties to return.
Associations
While you cannot set associations using this API, you can retrieve association information by making a GET request to the following URL:
crm/v3/objects/invoice/{`hs_object_id}`/associations/{associatedObjectName}
Associated objects can include
contacts
,
companies
,
deals
,
line items
,
discounts
,
fees
, and
taxes
. To create associations between an invoice and these objects, you can
update the invoice in HubSpot
.
Below is an example of how you might use this API combined with another API to get a specific set of association information.
Please note:
line items belong to one single parent object. For example, if retrieving line items from an invoice, the line item ID’s will be different to those on a deal, or a quote.
Retrieving an invoice with associated line items
To retrieve an invoice and the line items associated with it, make a
GET
request to:
crm/v3/objects/invoice/{`hs_object_id}`/associations/line_items
This will return the IDs of the currently associated line items, along with meta information about the association type.
Copy code snippet
// Example response
{
"results": [
{
"id": "1526712436",
"type": "invoice_to_line_item"
},
{
"id": "1526712437",
"type": "invoice_to_line_item"
}
]
}
xxxxxxxxxx
13
1
// Example response
2
{
3
"results"
: [
4
{
5
"id"
:
"1526712436"
,
6
"type"
:
"invoice_to_line_item"
7
},
8
{
9
"id"
:
"1526712437"
,
10
"type"
:
"invoice_to_line_item"
11
}
12
]
13
}
You can then use the returned IDs to request more information about the line items through the
line items API
. For example, you could batch retrieve line items by ID by making a
POST
request to the following URL with the request body below:
crm/v3/objects/line_items/batch/read
Copy code snippet
// Example request body
{
"inputs": [{ "id": "1526712436" }, { "id": "1526712437" }],
"properties": ["name", "amount"]
}
xxxxxxxxxx

// Example request body

{
3
"inputs"
: [{
"id"
:
"1526712436"
}, {
"id"
:
"1526712437"
}],
4
"properties"
: [
"name"
,
"amount"
]
5
}
The response would be formatted as follows:
Copy code snippet
// Example response
{
"status":"COMPLETE",
"results":[
{
"id":"1359205183",
"properties":{
"amount":"123.00",
"createdate":"2023-04-26T14:52:35.885Z"
"hs_lastmodifieddate":"2023-04-26T14:52:35.885Z",
"hs_object_id":"1359205183",
"name":"itemname"
},
"createdAt":"2023-04-26T14:52:35.885Z",
"updatedAt":"2023-04-26T14:52:35.885Z",
"archived":false
}
],
"startedAt":"2024-03-11T20:09:44.151Z",
"completedAt":"2024-03-11T20:09:44.195Z"

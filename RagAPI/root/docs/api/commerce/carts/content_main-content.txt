CRM API | Carts
Carts
Carts endpoint reference
Use the carts API to create and manage data related to ecommerce purchases in HubSpot. This can be especially useful for keeping HubSpot data synced with external ecommerce platforms, such as Shopify and NetSuite.
For example, use the API to sync cart data with Shopify, including associating the cart with an order and contact record.
Create carts
To create a cart, make a
POST
request to
crm/v3/objects/cart
.
In the request body, you can include the
properties
and
associations
objects to set property values and associate the cart with other CRM objects (e.g., contacts and line items). Learn more about order properties and associations below.
Properties
Cart details are stored in cart properties. HubSpot provides a set of
default cart properties
, but you can also create your own custom properties using the
properties API
.
To include properties when creating a cart, add them as fields in a
properties
object in the request body.For example, the request body below would create a cart with some basic product details based on the information provided by the buyer at checkout.
Copy code snippet
// Example POST request body
{
"properties": {
"hs_cart_name": "name-of-cart",
"hs_external_cart_id": "1234567890",

Associations
You can associate carts with other HubSpot CRM objects at creation by including an
associations
object. You can also use the
associations API
to update existing carts after creation.
In the
associations
array, include the following fields:
Fields
Type
Description
toObjectId
String
The ID of the record that you want to associate the cart with.
associationTypeId
String
A unique identifier to indicate the association type between the cart and the other object. Below are the CRM objects that you can associate orders with, along with their
associationTypeId
:
Contacts
:
586
Discounts
:
588
Line items
:
590
Orders
:
592
Quotes
:
732
Tasks
:
728
Tickets
:
594
To see a list of all association types, check out the
associations API documentation
. Or, you can retrieve each value by making a
GET
request to
/crm/v4/associations/{fromObjectType}/{toObjectType}/labels
.
For example, the
POST
request body below would create a cart that's associated with a specific contact and two line items.
Copy code snippet
// Example request body

Retrieve carts
Depending on the information you need, there are a few ways to retrieve carts:
To retrieve all carts, make a
GET
request to
/crm/v3/objects/cart
.
To retrieve a specific cart, make a
GET
request to the above URL and specify a cart ID. For example:
/crm/v3/objects/cart/44446244097
.
To retrieve carts that meet a specific set of criteria, you can make a
POST
request to the search endpoint and include filters in the request body. Learn more about
searching the CRM
.
The response will include a few default properties, including the create date, last modified date.

.
Search for carts by properties
You can use the search endpoint to retrieve carts that meet a specific set of
filter criteria
. This will be a
POST
request that includes your filter criteria in the request body.
For example, to search for all carts placed at a specific store, you would make a
POST
request to
crm/v3/objects/cart/search
with the following request body:
Copy code snippet
// Example search request body
{
"filterGroups": [
{
"filters": [
{
"propertyName": "hs_source_store",

Retrieve a cart with associations
To retrieve a cart and the contact associated with it, make a
GET
request to:
crm/v3/objects/cart/{cartId}/associations/contact
This will return the IDs of the currently associated contact, along with meta information about the association type.
Copy code snippet
// Example response
{
"results": [
{
"id": "301",
"type": "cart_to_contact"

}

]

}
You can then use the returned IDs to request more information about the contact through the
contacts API
. Using the above example response, you would make a
GET
request to
crm/v3/objects/contacts/301
.
Copy code snippet
// Example response

Update carts
To update a cart, make a
PATCH
request to
/crm/v3/objects/cart/{cartId}
. In the request body, include a
properties
object containing the properties that you want to update.

To update the associations for an existing cart, make a
PUT
request to
/crm/v3/objects/cart/{cartId}/associations/{toObjectType}/{toObjectId}/{associationTypeId}
. You can also use the
associations API
.
See the
associations section
for
associationTypeId
values for cart-to-object associations. You can also make a
GET
request to
/crm/v4/associations/{fromObjectType}/{toObjectType}/labels
.
To see all a list of all values, check out the
associations API documentation
.
For example, to associate a cart with an existing order, you would make a
PUT
request to the following URL:
/crm/v3/objects/cart/{cartId}/associations/order/{orderId}/592
The response will return a set of default properties along with an
associations
object containing information about the association that you set.

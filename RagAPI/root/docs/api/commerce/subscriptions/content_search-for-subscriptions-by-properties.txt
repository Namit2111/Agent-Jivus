Subscriptions API
Subscriptions
Subscriptions endpoint reference
Use the subscriptions API to fetch information about an account's
commerce subscriptions
. This is a read-only API, so it cannot be used for creating new or managing existing subscriptions. If you're looking to manage marketing email subscriptions instead, check out the
subscription preferences API
.
For example, use this API to
fetch all currently active subscriptions
.
Requirements
To use this API, the account must be set up to collect payments through either
HubSpot payments
or
Stripe payment processing
.
Retrieve subscriptions
Depending on the information you need, there are a few ways to retrieve subscriptions:
To retrieve all subscriptions, make a
GET
request to
crm/v3/objects/subscriptions
.
To retrieve a specific subscription, make a
GET
request to the above URL and specify a subscription ID. For example:
crm/v3/objects/subscriptions/41112146008
.
To retrieve subscriptions that meet a specific set of criteria, you can make a
POST
request to the search endpoint and include filters in the request body. See an example of using the
search endpoint below
.
The response will include a few default properties, including the create date, last modified date.

"hs_createdate": "2023-03-08T14:54:17.333Z",

Properties
To return specific properties, include a
properties
query parameter in the request URL along with comma-separated property names. For example, making a
GET
request to the following URL would result in the response below:
crm/v3/objects/subscriptions?properties=hs_status,hs_last_payment_amount
Copy code snippet
// Example response
{
"id": "41112146008",
"properties": {

"hs_object_id": "41112146008",
"hs_status": "active"

To view all available subscription properties, make a
GET
request to
crm/v3/properties/subscriptions
. Learn more about using the
properties API
.
Below are some common subscription properties that you may want to query.
Property name

hs_recurring_billing_start_date

hs_last_payment_amount

hs_next_payment_due_date
Next payment due date
The date that the next payment is due.
Search for subscriptions by properties
You can use the search endpoint to retrieve subscriptions that meet a specific set of
filter criteria
. This will be a
POST
request that includes your filter criteria in the request body.
For example, to search for all currently active subscriptions, you would make a
POST
request to
crm/v3/objects/subscriptions/search
with the following request body:
Copy code snippet
// Example search request body
{
"filterGroups": [
{
"filters": [
{
"propertyName": "hs_status",
"value": "active",
"operator": "EQ"
}
]
}
],
"properties": ["hs_status", "hs_last_payment_amount"]
}
xxxxxxxxxx

// Example search request body

"filterGroups"

{

"filters"

{

"propertyName"
:
"hs_status"
,
8
"value"

,

"operator"
:
"EQ"
10
}
11
]
12
}
13
],
14
"properties"
: [
"hs_status"
,
"hs_last_payment_amount"
]
15
}
Note that the
filters
array specifies the search criteria, while the
properties
array specifies which properties to return.
Associations
While you cannot set associations using this API, you can retrieve association information by making a GET request to the following URL:
crm/v3/objects/subscriptions/{hs_object_id}/associations/{associatedObjectName}
Associated objects can include
contacts
,
companies
,
deals
,
quotes
,
line items
,
payments
,
discounts
,
fees
, and
taxes
. These associations are typically set by the payment link or quote associated with the initial subscription payment. To manage these associations, you can
update the subscription in HubSpot
.
Below is an example of how you might use this API combined with another API to get a specific set of association information.
Please note:
line items belong to one single parent object. For example, if retrieving line items from a subscription, the line item ID’s will be different to those on a deal, or a quote.
Retrieving a subscription with associated line items
To retrieve a subscription and the line items associated with it, make a
GET
request to:
crm/v3/objects/subscription/{hs_object_id}/associations/line_items
This will return the IDs of the currently associated line items, along with meta information about the association type.
Copy code snippet
// Example response
{
"results": [
{
"id": "1459694380",
"type": "subscription_to_line_item"
},
{
"id": "1459694381",
"type": "subscription_to_line_item"
}
]
}
xxxxxxxxxx
13
1
// Example response
2
{
3
"results"
: [
4
{
5
"id"
:
"1459694380"
,
6
"type"
:
"subscription_to_line_item"
7
},
8
{
9
"id"
:
"1459694381"
,
10
"type"
:
"subscription_to_line_item"
11
}
12
]
13
}
You can then use the returned IDs to request more information about the line items through the
line items API
. For example, you could batch retrieve line items by ID with the following
POST
request:
crm/v3/objects/line_items/batch/read
Copy code snippet
// Example request body
{
"inputs": [{ "id": "1459694380" }, { "id": "1459694381" }],
"properties": ["name", "amount"]
}
xxxxxxxxxx

1
// Example request body
2
{
3
"inputs"
: [{
"id"
:
"1459694380"
}, {
"id"
:
"1459694381"
}],
4
"properties"
: [
"name"
,
"amount"
]
5
}
The response would be formatted as follows:
Copy code snippet
// Example response
{
"status": "COMPLETE",
"results": [
{
"id": "1459694381",
"properties": {
"amount": "100.00",
"createdate": "2023-11-08T18:23:06.361Z",
"hs_lastmodifieddate": "2023-11-08T18:23:06.361Z",

"name": "Recurring line item 2"
},

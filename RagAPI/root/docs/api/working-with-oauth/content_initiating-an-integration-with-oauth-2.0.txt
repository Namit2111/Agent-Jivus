Working with OAuth
Working with OAuth
OAuth is a secure means of authentication that uses authorization tokens rather than a password to connect your app to a user account. Initiating OAuth access is the first step towards allowing users to
install your app
in their HubSpot accounts.
Please note:
any app designed for installation by multiple HubSpot accounts or listing on the App Marketplace must use OAuth.
users installing apps in their HubSpot account must either be a
super admin
or have
App Marketplace Access
permissions.
Recommended resources
The
OAuth Quickstart Guide
will get you up and running with a working example app.
This
HubSpot Academy tutorial
provides a quick introduction on using OAuth with HubSpot, including a breakdown of the HubSpot-OAuth flow and how to refresh an access token.
Initiating an integration with OAuth 2.0
To initiate an integration with OAuth 2.0:
First,
create an app
in a
HubSpot developer account
. After creating the app, you'll be able to find the app's client ID and client secret on the
Auth
page of your app settings.
Use the client ID and client secret, along with the
query parameters
and
scopes
outlined below, to build your authorization URL.
Send users installing your app to the authorization URL, where they'll be presented with a screen that allows them to select their account and grant access to your integration. You can set the authorization URL to be for a specific HubSpot account by adding the account ID between
/oauth/
and
/authorize
, as shown below. After granting access, they'll be redirected back to your application via a
redirect_url
, which will have a code query parameter appended to it. You'll use that code and the client secret to get an
access_token and refresh_token
from HubSpot.
Example authorization URLs
Any account:
https://app.hubspot.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx&scope=contacts%20automation&redirect_uri=https://www.example.com/
Specific account (ID 123456):
https://app.hubspot.com/oauth/123456/authorize?client_id=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx&scope=contacts%20automation&redirect_uri=https://www.example.com/
Example redirect URL:
https://example.com/?code=xxxx
Example error:
https://www.example.com/?error=error_code&error_description=Human%20readable%20description%20of%20the%20error
Use the
access_token
to authenticate any API calls made for that HubSpot account.
Once the
access_token
expires, use the
refresh_token
to generate a new
access_token
.
Please note:
your app will not appear as a
Connected App
in a user's account unless you generate the refresh token and initial access token.
access tokens reflect the scopes requested from the app and
do not
reflect the permissions or limitations of what a user can do in their HubSpot account. For example, if a user has permissions to view only owned contacts but authorizes a request for the
crm.objects.contacts.read
scope, the resulting access token can view all contacts in the account and not only those owned by the authorizing user.
Query parameters
The following parameters are required when building an authorization URL for your app:
Parameter
Description
How to use
Client ID
client_id=x
Used in the URL
Get this from your app's Auth settings page (as described above).
Redirect URL
redirect_uri=x
The URL visitors will be redirected to after granting access to your app.
You'll also designate this on your app's Auth settings page.
Note:
For security reasons, this URL
must
use https in production. (When testing using localhost, http can be used.) You also
must
use a domain, as IP addresses are not supported.
Scope
scope=x%20x
A space-separated set of permissions that your app needs access to. Any scopes that you've checked off in your app's Auth settings will be treated as required, and you'll need to include them in this parameter or the authorization page will display an error.Additionally, users will get an error if they try to install your app on an account that doesn't have access to an included scope.See the Scopes table below for more details about which endpoints can be accessed by specific scopes.
The following parameters are optional:
Parameter
How to use
Description
Optional scopes
&optional_scope=x%20x
A space-separated set of optional permissions for your app. Optional scopes will be automatically dropped from the authorization request if the user selects a HubSpot account that does not have access to that tool (such as requesting the social scope on a CRM only portal). If you're using optional scopes, you will need to check the access token or refresh token to see which ones were granted. See the table below for more details about scopes.
State
&state=y
If this parameter is included in the authorization URL, the value will be included in a state query parameter when the user is directed to the
redirect_url
.
A string value that can be used to maintain the user's state when they're redirected back to your app.
Configure scopes
OAuth requires you to set scopes, or permissions, for your app. Each scope provides access to a set of HubSpot API endpoints and allows users to grant your app access to specific tools in their HubSpot account.
Access to specific APIs or endpoints depends on HubSpot account tier. You can find a full list of available scopes and accessible endpoints in the table below. If your app can work with multiple types of HubSpot accounts, you can use the
optional_scope
parameter to include any tiered scopes you work. This way, customers using CRM-only accounts can still authorize your app, even if they can't access all of its scopes. Your app must check for and handle any scopes that it doesn't get authorized for.

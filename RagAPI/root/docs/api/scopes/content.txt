Scopes
Scopes provide access to a specific set of HubSpot API endpoints and the associated data from a HubSpot account. If you created a private app, you can specify which scopes your app has access to in your
private app settings
. If you're developing a public app, you'll
configure both required and optional scopes
that users who install your app will be prompted to authorize via the app's install URL.
Find required scopes for an endpoint
Any scopes required to make a request to a specific endpoint will be listed under the
Requirements
section in the endpoint documentation, which can be accessed by clicking the
Endpoints
tab in an API reference article.
Some scopes may list both
Standard
and
Granular
scopes. If both scope types are listed, you should opt for using the granular scopes when possible, as they specify more explicit access for your API requests.
List of available scopes
Access to specific APIs or endpoints depends on HubSpot account tier. You can find a full list of available scopes and accessible endpoints in the table below.

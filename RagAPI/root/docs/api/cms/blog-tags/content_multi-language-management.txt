Blog tags endpoint reference
Use the blog tags API to manage tags for your blog posts. Learn more about how to create and maintain your blog on the
HubSpot Knowledge Base.
Changes in V3
The
description
property has been deprecated and will not be included in the response of any of the V3 endpoints.
Search blog tags
To retrieve blog tags, make a
GET
request to
/cms/v3/blogs/tags
. You can filter and sort the tags returned in the response using the operators and properties below. You can also use the standard filters using the
createdAt
and
updatedAt
dates.
Filtering
Provide any filters as query parameters in your request by adding the
property name
, followed by
two underscore characters
, then include the associated
operator
as a suffix. For example, you can filter the results to only include blog tags where the
name
property contains the word
marketing
using the parameter:
&name__icontains=marketing
.
You can include any number of filters as query parameters in the request URL. All filters are ANDed together. ORing filters is not currently supported.
The available filter types are listed below:

To filter blog tags based on a multi-language group, you can include one of the query parameters from the table below. For example, to get blog tags from the German variation of your blog, you'd include
language__in=de
as a query parameter.
Please note:
languages with locales (e.g.,
en-us
) are not supported with the
language
filter.
Sorting and paginating
You can provide sorting and pagination options as query parameters. Specify the
property name
as the value to the sort query parameter to return the blog tags in the natural order of that property. You can reverse the sorting order by including a dash character before the property name (e.g.,
sort=-createdAt
).
By combining query parameters for filtering, sorting, and paging, you can retrieve blog tags that match more advanced search criteria. For example, the request below fetches blog tags that have a language assigned, ordered by the most recently updated. Including the
limit
and
offset
parameters below returns the second page of results.

Multi-language management
To help you maintain blog tags across multiple languages, HubSpot's CMS allows you to group together blog tags of language variants of the same content. A tag with a language set may only be used on blog posts of the same language. Tags that do not have a language set are considered global and may be used on all blog posts.

this Knowledge Base article
.

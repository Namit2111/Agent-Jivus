Quote template variables
Quote template variables
Custom quote templates can access quote data and some associated objects directly from the templates. The data available depends on data you have in your CRM, as well as data added to the quote itself.
While developing a quote template, you can use HubSpot-provided mock data to populate the template, which may help for previewing the template. In the
@hubspot
folder, navigate to the
cms-quotes-theme
folder. Within the
templates
folder, view the
basic.html
,
modern.html
, or
original.html
templates. These templates contain the following code block at the top:
Copy code snippet
{% from "../imports/mock_data.html" import SAMPLE_TEMPLATE_DATA as mock_data %}
{% from "../imports/module_defaults.html" import MODULE_DEFAULTS as module_defaults %}
{% set QUOTE = template_data.quote || mock_data.quote %}
{% set CURRENCY = QUOTE.hs_currency || "USD" %}
{% set LOCALE = QUOTE.hs_locale || "en-US" %}
{% set ASSOCIATED_OBJECTS = QUOTE.associated_objects %}
{% set LINE_ITEMS = ASSOCIATED_OBJECTS.line_items %}
{% set ADDITIONAL_FEES = ASSOCIATED_OBJECTS.additional_fees %}
{% set TOTALS = ASSOCIATED_OBJECTS.totals || ASSOCIATED_OBJECTS.totals %}
{% set QUOTE_TOTAL = TOTALS.total %}
{% set SUB_TOTALS = TOTALS.subtotals %}
{% set DEAL = ASSOCIATED_OBJECTS.deal %}

{%
from
"../imports/mock_data.html"
import
SAMPLE_TEMPLATE_DATA
as
mock_data
%}
2
{%
from
"../imports/module_defaults.html"
import
MODULE_DEFAULTS
as
module_defaults
%}

{%
set
QUOTE
=
template_data.quote
||
mock_data.quote
%}

{%
set
CURRENCY
=
QUOTE.hs_currency

{%

The mock data is first imported from the
mock_data.html
file, then is set to the
QUOTE
variable to use the data found in
template_data
if available. The
QUOTE
variable is also used to populate the other variables in this list, such as
ASSOCIATED_OBJECTS
, to make accessing that data less verbose. However, you can structure your data differently, depending on your preferences.
In the above code, you'll notice that
template_data
is also used to set the main
QUOTE
variable.
template_data
is an object containing all of the actual data for the quote and deal in the page. If that object is not found in the template, HubSpot loads the data from
mock_data.html
instead.
Template_data object
The vast majority of the data can be directly accessed through the
template_data
object. You can use
{{ template_data|pprint }}
in your template to see the full object provided.

Can't find a variable you're looking for?
There are more variables you can access within
template_data
. Use
|pprint
to view them. Additionally some variables in quote associations may only be available based on the quote/deal.
We will be iterating on this documentation to showcase and explain more of the data you have access to. Aside from pretty printing, you can view the mock data file within the cms-quote-theme, to see what is available and the structure it comes in.
Associated objects
In a quote template, you can access data from a quote's associated records, such as deals or companies, by using
associated_objects
.
For example, you can add the logo from the quote recipient's associated company record to a quote by using the following code:
Copy code snippet
{% set company_avatar_url = template_data.quote.associated_objects.company.hs_avatar_filemanager_key %}
{% if company_avatar_url %}
<img src="{{ template_data.quote.associated_objects.company.hs_avatar_filemanager_key }}" width="400" alt="{{ template_data.quote.associated_objects.company.name }}">
{% else %}
<!-- company does not have an assigned image-->
{% endif %}
xxxxxxxxxx
6
1
{%
set
company_avatar_url
=
template_data.quote.associated_objects.company.hs_avatar_filemanager_key
%}
2
{%
if
company_avatar_url
%}
3
<
img
src
=
"
{{
template_data.quote.associated_objects.company.hs_avatar_filemanager_key
}}
"
width
=
"400"
alt
=
"
{{
template_data.quote.associated_objects.company.name
}}
"
>
4
{%
else
%}
5
<!-- company does not have an assigned image-->
6
{%
endif
%}
Please note:
only manually set logos will appear. Automatically detected logos will not appear to prevent unintentional logos from appearing on the quote template.
The above code first sets a variable that searches for the quote's associated company's logo. Then, using an
if
statement, the template displays that logo, if available. If no logo has been manually set for the company, no logo is displayed.
Custom Objects
Custom object data can be displayed or used within a quote in a couple different ways. Because each custom object's structure may vary, you'll need to get specific properties based on how you've structured your custom object.
The quote
template_data
by default has custom associated objects in it. For example, custom objects associated with deals are included.
To access them, you can use the following code:
Copy code snippet
{% set quote_associated_custom_objects = template_data.quote.associated_objects.deal.associated_objects.custom_objects %}
{{ quote_associated_custom_objects|pprint }}
{# |pprint is useful for understanding the structure of the data, you can leave it off when outputting values for display. #}
​
x
1
{%
set
quote_associated_custom_objects
=
template_data.quote.associated_objects.deal.associated_objects.custom_objects
%}
2
​
3
{{
quote_associated_custom_objects
|
pprint
}}
4
{#
|pprint is useful for understanding the structure of the data, you can leave it off when outputting values for display.
#}
Please note:
because custom objects are unique to each account, the mock data doesn't include an example custom object. This means that in the template preview in the design manager you may see an error or the custom object data simply won't display. You'll instead need to preview the template with your real CRM data, which you can do by creating a quote from the template.
You can then access each custom object type by appending its custom object type ID formatted with underscores. For example:
template_data.quote.associated_objects.deal.associated_objects.custom_objects._2_2193031
You can also look up a custom object by using the
crm_associations()
function and
crm_objects()
functions.
For example, if you wanted to look up a custom object associated with a deal, you could pass in data from
template_data
:
Copy code snippet
{% set quote_associated_object = crm_associations(template_data.quote.associated_objects.deal.hs_object_id, "USER_DEFINED", 152) %}
{# 152 is an example of an association type id, you would need to use the appropriate id for your use-case. #}
{{ quote_associated_object }}
xxxxxxxxxx
3
1
{%
set
quote_associated_object
=
crm_associations(template_data.quote.associated_objects.deal.hs_object_id,
"USER_DEFINED"
,
152
)
%}
2
{#
152 is an example of an association type id, you would need to use the appropriate id for your use-case.
#}
3
{{
quote_associated_object
}}

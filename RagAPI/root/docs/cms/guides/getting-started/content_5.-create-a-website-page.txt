Quickstart guide to developing on the HubSpot CMS
HubSpot CMS quickstart guide
HubSpot's CMS is a powerful, flexible platform for creating HubSpot websites, including website pages, blogs, and lightweight apps. It features built-in security and reliability features, along with a globally distributed Content Delivery Network (CDN) that ensures fast page load times.
When developing on the HubSpot CMS, you can use your preferred tools, technologies, and workflows, such as
GitHub
, while developing websites. Content creators can then create pages and publish content using drag and drop editors. And because the CMS is integrated with the CRM, you can
create dynamic website experiences
for your visitors based on the data you already have.
Before you begin
Before you start, ensure you've done the following:
Create a free test account to build without impacting a production environment. You can use either of the following types of accounts:
Create a
developer account
, then create a
test account
within it. Because you can also build private apps in developer test accounts, along with building public apps in developer accounts, you'll have one home for both CMS and app development.
Create a
CMS developer sandbox account
.
Install
Node.js
, which enables HubSpot's local development tools. Versions 18 or higher are supported.
1. Install the HubSpot CLI
Once you're ready to begin, open a terminal window and create or navigate to the directory where you want your local HubSpot files to live. This working directory is where the theme and its associated files will be placed.
Next, run
npm install -g @hubspot/cli@latest
to install the HubSpot CLI, which introduces an
hs
command that allows you to easily interact with your HubSpot account.
2. Configure the local development tools
Run
hs init
to connect the tools to your HubSpot account. This command will walk you through the following steps:
First you’ll be guided to create a personal access key to enable authenticated access to your account via the local development tools. You’ll be prompted to press "Enter" when you’re ready to open the
Personal Access Key page
in your default browser. This page will allow you to view or generate your personal access key, if necessary. (Note: You’ll need to select at least the "Design Manager" permission in order to complete this tutorial.) Copy your access key and paste it in the terminal.
Next, you’ll enter a name for the account. This name is only seen and used by you, For example, you might use "sandbox" if you're using a developer sandbox or "company.com" if you’re using a full customer account. This name will be used when running commands.
Once you've completed this simple
init
flow, you'll see a success message confirming that a configuration file,
hubspot.config.yml
, has been created in your current directory.
3. Create a theme
Run
hs create website-theme my-website-theme
to create a
my-website-theme
directory populated with files from the
CMS theme boilerplate
.
4. Upload your theme to HubSpot
Run
hs upload my-website-theme my-website-theme
to upload your new theme to a
my-website-theme
folder in your HubSpot account.
Once this task has completed, you can view these files in the design manager of your HubSpot account. The design manager is an in-app code editor that displays the developer file system, and can be found by navigating to
Content > Design Manger
in the left sidebar of your account.
5. Create a website page
To experience how content creators will use your templates and modules, create a website page using the theme you just uploaded.
In your HubSpot account, navigate to
Content > Website Pages
In the upper right, click
Create
, then select
Website page
.
In the dialog box, enter a
name
for your page, then click
Create page
.
On the next page, select the
my-website-theme
theme if it's not already selected. Then, hover over the
Homepage
template and click
Select template
.
You'll then be brought to the website page editor where you can explore all of the options that content creators will have when working with the template. Learn more about using the editor to build and customize pages on
HubSpot's Knowledge Base
.
Click the
Settings
tab in the editor, then select
General
. Enter a
Page title
, then set a
Content slug
to finalize the page's URL. Then, close out the dialog box by clicking
X
or pressing the
Escape key
.
In the upper right, click
Publish
to take your page live.
6. Edit a CSS file
Run
hs watch my-website-theme my-website-theme
. While
watch
is running, every time you save a file, it’ll be automatically uploaded. Open your theme's
/css/components/_footer.css
file in your editor, make a change (such as updating the
.footer__copyright
selector to have
color: red;
), and save your changes. Your terminal will show that the saved file has been uploaded.
Reload your published page to see the CSS change reflected on your website.
What's next?
You're encouraged to continue to explore and experiment with the boilerplate theme and the page-building experience. The sandbox account you created is yours to play around in and experiment with.

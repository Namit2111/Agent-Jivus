Websites built on HubSpot's CMS automatically use HubSpot's global CDN with hundreds of local points of presence. However, you may have an existing CDN or complex routing rules that are not possible to maintain using HubSpot's built-in CDN. In that case, you may want to set up a reverse proxy with HubSpot instead.
A reverse proxy is a type of proxy server that takes resources from one or more servers and then returns them to the client with the appearance of it coming from the proxy server itself. For example, you have an existing website at
www.website.com
which is
not
hosted on the HubSpot CMS, while also hosting a blog on HubSpot at
www.website.com/blog
. Using a reverse proxy, the blog would appear to be hosted from the same server as the website when it's actually coming from HubSpot's servers.
Below, learn more about how to set up a reverse proxy with HubSpot. By the end of the guide, you will have:
Reviewed the
considerations
for whether to set up a reverse proxy.
Configured the proxy
in your external environment. The guide includes general instructions as well as provider-specific instructions for
Amazon CloudFront
and
nginx
.
Confirmed that the configuration is correct
. This guide also includes troubleshooting steps if you're seeing a
404
error during that process.
Added the domain to HubSpot
to enable content creation in HubSpot.
Note that this guide assumes that you have an existing website or app that uses a CDN or web service which supports reverse proxies.
Please note:
Reverse proxy setup is
not
provided by HubSpot's support team.
You may purchase time with a HubSpot Technical Consultant
for support with implementing a reverse proxy on HubSpot, or use our
community forums for peer-to-peer support
.
HubSpot’s built-in CDN and all other services have multiple instances with automatic failover and recovery. If you implement a reverse proxy, it's highly recommend that you use multiple instances with load balancing. If all requests are instead routed through a single proxy node, it’s possible that requests will trip rate limiting protocols. This would result in requests being served
429
or
403
responses until an in-browser JavaScript challenge is completed.
Considerations
Using your own CDN or reverse proxy may open up more configuration options, but it also requires significant operational knowledge and maintenance. Additionally, if you proxy a subpath of your site to HubSpot, your main
sitemap.xml
file won't include HubSpot pages unless you manually add them.
Before proceeding with a reverse proxy setup, review the list of feature considerations below.

1. Configure the proxy
Adding a custom reverse proxy means that users of your website will make a request to your service and then be proxied through to HubSpot’s CDN, introducing another network hop.
To start the proxy setup process, first configure the proxy in your external environment, such as a CDN like
Amazon CloudFront
or an
nginx
server.
You should always implement the proxy in a load balanced environment so that traffic from your proxy rotates requests to the HubSpot CNAME origin from multiple IP addresses.
The CNAME needed for the proxy will be in the following format:
<HubID>.<suffix>
, where suffix is determined by the last two digits of your HubID. Use the table below to match the last two digits of your HubID with a suffix.
HubIDs ending with
Suffix
00-10
sites-proxy.hscoscdn00.net
11-19
sites-proxy.hscoscdn10.net
20-29
sites-proxy.hscoscdn20.net
30-39
sites-proxy.hscoscdn30.net
40-49
sites-proxy.hscoscdn40.net

sites-proxy.hscoscdn20.net
80-89
sites-proxy.hscoscdn30.net
90-99
sites-proxy.hscoscdn40.net
For example, if your HubID is
123456
, your correct origin CNAME would be
123456.sites-proxy.hscoscdn00.net
.
Below are general instructions for configuring a reverse proxy, as well as specific guidance for
Amazon CloudFront
and
nginx
.

Content Hub
Enterprise
and
Cloudflare Enterprise
, learn more about setting up an
Orange-to-Orange (O2O)
reverse proxy configuration in Cloudflare.
General instructions
In general, you can configure your proxy to forward requests using your origin CNAME and add the following configurations:
Set your proxy to perform no caching for paths originating from HubSpot. HubSpot automatically manages the content of our CDN’s cache so pages are updated automatically when content is published. Note that if the service caches responses, ​pages may not update for hours or days​.
Add or prepend to a ​
X-Forwarded-For
​ header with the client IP address of the original requestor. This is required to differentiate clients from each other. Many services such as CloudFront maintain these headers automatically.
To ensure personalized content based on location works, pass a static header of
X-HubSpot-Trust-Forwarded-For: true
​. This will trust the
​X-Forwarded-For​
header, which may not have been updated by all upstream proxies.
Pass a ​
X-HS-Public-Host
​ header with a value of your destination domain.
Allow all HTTP methods.
Ensure an SSL certificate is provisioned and installed for your proxy domain.
Forward all query strings.
Forward ​
all
​ other request and response headers as-is, including cookies.
Ideally, all paths under your domain should proxy to HubSpot. If that’s not the case, then the following paths must proxy so assets load properly from your domain:
/_hcms/*
,
/hs/*
,
/hubfs/*
,
/hs-fs/*​
,
/cs/c/*
, and
/e3t/*
.
2. Confirm your configuration is correct
In accounts with
CMS Hub
Enterprise
, you can identify issues with your configuration in your HubSpot domain settings:
In your HubSpot account, click the
settings icon
in the main navigation bar.
In the left sidebar menu, navigate to
Website
>
Domains & URLs
.
Next to the domain you are using for your reverse proxy, click the
Edit
dropdown menu and select
Verify Reverse Proxy Connection
.
Click any
category
that is labeled as
Failed
to view recommendations for fixing the issue.
Once you've implemented your fixes, click
Refresh test
to check your configuration again.
Please note:
if you see an error in your domain settings stating that “Reverse proxy domains need your action to avoid website disruption,” learn how to
set up a Domain Control Validation (DCV) record
.
For all other accounts, to can confirm your configuration, visit:
https://[yourFullDomain]/_hcms/diagnostics
Verify the following information:
The current time value changes on every load. This confirms that the page is not cached.
The
User-Agent
is consistent with your browser.
The
Accept-Language
value is consistent with your browser.
The
Accept-Encoding
header is
*
. This ensures that responses are compressed.
The
Cookie
value is not blank.
The
Protocol
is
https
.
The leftmost IP address in
X-Forwarded-For
matches your IP address as reported by a service like
https://www.whatismyip.com
.
The
IP-Determined Location
values are accurate to your location. These are based on the IP-related headers in
X-Forwarded-For
.
Troubleshooting
If you're seeing a
404
when going to the diagnostics URL, that likely means you have an issue with your configuration.
Visit
https://[yourFullDomain]/_hcms/_worker/headers
to view all the headers that HubSpot is receiving from a request through your reverse proxy.
The most important headers for proxies are:
X-Forwarded-For
X-HubSpot-Trust-Forwarded-For
X-HS-Public-Host
Verify you are not sending additional/unnecessary headers, or duplicate values.
Clicks registered as bot events
If you're using Amazon CloudFront and are seeing clicks registered as bot events, the User-Agent is likely being set as Amazon CloudFront instead of the visitor's User-Agent. To fix this, update your
managed origin request policies
to forward the visitor's User-Agent instead.
3. Add the domain to HubSpot
With your proxy configured, you’ll then add your domain to HubSpot. You will
not
be fully connecting the domain to HubSpot in the way that you would in the standard domain connection process. Rather, you’ll start the connection process to make the domain available for publishing HubSpot content, but you will not create CNAME records in your DNS provider. By the end of this process, your proxy will receive all requests to the domain and can choose to proxy certain paths to HubSpot and other paths to other content hosts.
To add your domain to HubSpot:
In your HubSpot account, navigate to your
domain settings
.
Click
Connect a domain
.
Select
Primary
or
Secondary
. Redirect and email sending domains are not supported for this feature.
Click to toggle the
Connect with HubSpot's built-in content delivery network (CDN)
switch off, then click
Connect
.
Select the
content type
you’ll be hosting on the domain, then click
Next
.
Enter the
brand domain
. For example, for
www.website.com
, you would enter
website.com
.
Please note:
this domain must match the domain being requested through your reverse proxy.
Enter the
subdomain
that you’ll be hosting content on. The subdomain needs to match the subdomain for the externally hosted domain. Then click
Next
.
Review the domain you’ve entered, then click
Next
.
Next, verify your domain so that HubSpot can confirm your domain ownership and allow content publishing:
In your DNS provider, create the records using the provided values.
In HubSpot, click
Verify
. It can take up to 4 hours for HubSpot to recognize changes made to your DNS provider and verify your hostname.
Provider-specific instructions
While you can use the
general instructions above
to set up your proxy, below are steps for setting up a reverse proxy with
Amazon CloudFront
and
nginx
specifically.
Please note:
if you have both
Content Hub
Enterprise
and
Cloudflare Enterprise
, learn more about setting up an
Orange-to-Orange (O2O)
reverse proxy configuration in Cloudflare.
Set up a reverse proxy in Amazon CloudFront
To set up a reverse proxy in Amazon CloudFront, you’ll need to create a new distribution with a new alternate domain name, create a new origin, then create cache behaviors for the page paths where your HubSpot content is hosted. You can learn more about working with distributions in the
AWS documentation
.
Log in to your Amazon CloudFront account.
In the left sidebar, navigate to
Distributions
.
If you’re starting from scratch, you’ll first need to create a new distribution by clicking
Create Distribution
. Alternatively, you can edit an existing distribution or skip to the
origin and behaviors setup steps
.
On the
General
tab, click
Edit
.
In the
Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs)
field, add the domain, including the subdomain. This must match the domain you added to HubSpot.
Confirm your changes by clicking
Yes, Edit
. You’ll then be directed back to the
General
tab where your domain should now be listed next to
Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs)
.
You’ll also need to create a new CNAME record in your DNS provider using the value from the
Domain Name
field. This value should look something like
<value>.cloudfront.net
.
Next, set up a new origin:
Click the
Origins and Origin Groups
tab.
Click
Create Origin
, then set up your origin:
In the
Origin domain
field, enter the
<HubID>.<suffix>
CNAME value from the
table above
. This value should look something like
123.sites-proxy.hscoscdn20.net
.
Under
Add custom header
, click
Add header
. Then, add the following header details:
To ensure personalized content based on location works, either pass a
X-Client-IP
header with a value of the end user’s IP (preferred) or pass a static header of
X-HubSpot-Trust-Forwarded-For: true
. The latter will trust the
X-Forwarded-For
header, which may not have been updated by all upstream proxies.
Pass a
X-HS-Public-Host
header with a value of your destination domain.
Click
Create
to save your changes.
Then, set up
cache behaviors
for the page paths you’ll be hosting HubSpot content on:
Click the
Behaviors
tab.
Click
Create Behavior
.
In the
Path pattern
field, enter the URL path of the page that your HubSpot content is hosted on. This can be a path to a specific page, or a flexible URL such as a wildcard. Learn more about
path patterns
.
Click the
Origin and Origin Groups
field, then select the origin you created earlier.
Click
Save changes
.
With your distribution, origin, and behaviors configured, the reverse proxy will now be available for HubSpot pages that you create at the specified paths. Proceed to the steps for
configuring your domain in HubSpot
.
Please note:
by default, if no Origin Request Policy configuration is specified, Amazon CloudFront
strips cookies, query parameters and most of headers
before forwarding the request to your origin. This includes setting the User-Agent to
Amazon CloudFront
, which will result in clicks to be marked as bot events. To resolve this, you should
update origin request policies
to forward the visitor's User-Agent instead.
Set up a reverse proxy using nginx
To configure a reverse proxy with nginx, you’ll need to create a location configuration file that includes SSL information and the location path information.
Please note:
full documentation for setting up reverse proxies with nginx can be found in the
nginx documentation
. In particular, you may want to review documentation for settings such as
securing upstream traffic
,
proxy_ssl
, and
$proxy_protocol_addr
.
When working with nginx, there are several headers and settings required to route traffic. Below are snippets of a sample nginx location configuration file to use as a starting point.
Copy code snippet
location ~ ^(/|/some-other-path) {
proxy_set_header Host $http_host;

}
In the above code, note that the proxy connection and content host domain are different: one is a HubSpot provided CNAME (
see configuration table
), and the other is the domain that the content should be served from, matching the domain you’ll add to HubSpot. This is due to the SNI (Server Name Indication) connection process that establishes a secure connection between your proxy and HubSpot’s servers.
To enable this in your nginx proxy, ensure that you include the settings below, which are also in the above code:
Copy code snippet
proxy_ssl_name www.example.com;
proxy_ssl_server_name on;
xxxxxxxxxx
2
1
proxy_ssl_name www.example.com;
2
proxy_ssl_server_name on;
These settings instruct nginx to send the server domain name with the SNI SSL connection handshake since the origin domain is different from the Host.

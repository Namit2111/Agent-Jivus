In the sales process, a sales rep
creates a deal
, then the sales rep
creates a quote associated with that deal
. The sales rep sends the quote URL or PDF to a prospect. The prospect then accepts or declines the quote. In some cases payment is exchanged right away, in some cases an e-signature is used.
Please note:
you can create custom quote themes and templates with any HubSpot subscription, including
CMS Free
, but an account will need
Sales Hub
Professional
or
Enterprise
to use those templates for their quotes.
If you previous built proposal templates, learn
how to migrate an existing proposal template to quotes.
Overview
Custom quote templates are built using the same underlying systems that other types of templates use. For example:
Domain-level settings apply to quotes, including head and footer HTML and domain stylesheets. You can disable domain stylesheets using
template annotations.
Most of HubL's functionality works on quote templates, including functions, filters, if conditions, imports, and includes.
When using
personalization tokens
in a quote, HubSpot will not render them dynamically. Instead, the token is rendered at the time of publishing the quote, and will not update upon signing. For this reason, you should not use personalization tokens for properties that are updated after a quote is published, including:
Payment status
Payment date
Esign date
Esign completed signatures
Due to the specific use-case of quotes, however, there are some key differences between how quotes work from the way page and email templates work:
More data is available to the quote template that is restricted for other template types. For example, quote and deal-related data is available to a quote template. You can also include contact data for quote recipients in a quote template.
There is not currently a
drag and drop
editor for building quote templates. Instead, there is a module-based editor for customizing or hiding the modules that are already in a template.
Because more data is available to quote templates without requiring password protection. You should take care to only expose information that is truly required for the purpose of the quote.
Custom enumeration properties
Enumeration properties such as dropdown menus, or multiple checkboxes, can be incorporated into custom quote templates. See a list of all property types
here
.
The JSON returned for custom enumeration properties includes both the internal value, as well as the external label.
Please note:
by default, quotes created after September 13th, 2024 will display the property label, rather than the internal value.
Copy code snippet
custom_properties: {
my_custom_property: {
label:"Label1",
internal:"value1"
},
another_custom_property: {
label:"Label99",
internal:"value99"
}
}
1
custom_properties
: {
2
my_custom_property
: {
3
label
:
"Label1"
,
4
internal
:
"value1"

},
6
another_custom_property
: {
7
label
:
"Label99"
,
8
internal
:
"value99"
9
}
10
}
For CMS Developers using custom quote templates, the
crm_property_definition
function can be used to retrieve quote property data, and will allow you to replace the label with the value where necessary.
Copy code snippet
{% set dealEnum = template_data.quote.associated_objects.deal.deal_enum %}
{% set dealEnumProp = crm_property_definition("DEAL", "deal_enum").options|selectattr('label', "equalto", dealEnum)|first %}
{{ dealEnumProp.value }}
xxxxxxxxxx

{%
set
dealEnum
=
template_data.quote.associated_objects.deal.deal_enum
%}
2
{%
set
dealEnumProp
=
crm_property_definition(
"DEAL"
,
"deal_enum"
).options
|
selectattr(
'label'
,
"equalto"
, dealEnum)
|
first
%}
3
{{
dealEnumProp.value
}}
Enable e-signatures
In
Sales Hub
Starter
,
Professional
, and
Enterprise
accounts, quotes can be configured to include
e-signature functionality
. To enable this for custom quote templates, add the
quote_signature module
to the quote template.
Copy code snippet
<section class="signature">
{% module "signature" path="@hubspot/quote_signature" %}
</section>
xxxxxxxxxx
3
1
<
section
class
=
"signature"
>
2
{%
module
"signature"
path
=
"@hubspot/quote_signature"
%}

</
section
>
Because Dropbox Sign renders the print version of a quote for signing, ensure that the signature field is displayed in the
print version
of your quote. Otherwise, Dropbox Sign will display an error when the user goes to verify their signature.
Print and PDF versions of custom quotes
If you'd like to enable users to print or download a quote, it's recommended to include the
download module
. Alternatively, since a quote is a web page you can
use JavaScript and a button element
to provide an easy way to print the quote.
To optimize and style the print and PDF version of a quote template, you can use the
@media print
media query
in the template's stylesheet. For example, HubSpot's default
Basic
quote theme includes the following print styling in the
basic.css
stylesheet:
Copy code snippet
@media print {
.hs-quotes--basic {
max-width: unset;
}
.hs-quotes--basic .line-items__total-name {
float: left;
}
.hs-quotes--basic .comments,
.hs-quotes--basic .terms {
break-inside: avoid;
}
}
​

.hs-quotes--basic
{

;

}

​

.hs-quotes--basic
.line-items__total-name
{

float
:

;

}

​

.hs-quotes--basic
.comments
,
11
.hs-quotes--basic
.terms
{
12
break-inside
:
avoid
;
13
}
14
}
To preview the print version in Chrome:
Open the web version of a quote.
Right-click the page, then select
Inspect
.
In the top right of the DevTools panel, click the
three vertical dots
⋮
, then select
More tools
, then select
Rendering
.
In the
Rendering
panel, scroll to the
Emulate CSS media type
section. Then, click the
dropdown menu
and select
print
.
You can now continue to testing out styling in Chrome. When you're ready to apply the styling to the template, copy the styles into your
@media print
media query, then upload the template to HubSpot.
Updated styling will only apply to quotes created after updating the template. Existing quotes using the template will not be updated.

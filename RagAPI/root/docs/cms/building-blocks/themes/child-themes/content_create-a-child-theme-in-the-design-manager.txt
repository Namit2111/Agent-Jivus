A
child theme
is a copy of an original
parent theme
. You can edit the child theme without altering the parent theme. You can create child themes from default HubSpot themes, Asset Marketplace themes, and custom themes.
Please note:
creating a child theme lets you customize its theme settings without impacting the parent theme settings. However, creating a child theme will not create clones of each of the theme's templates, modules, or files such as stylesheets and JavaScript. You'll need to manually clone these assets to create copies for the child theme.
Create a child theme in the Design Manager
You can create a child theme in the Design Manager. You will be able to edit the child theme even if the original theme is not editable. The following files will be added to your child theme:
theme.json
- this will include an extends statement for linking to the parent theme.
child.css
and
child.js
- these are empty CSS and JS files. Code added to these files will only affect the child theme.
Any files that contain the
standard_header_includes
HubL variable
. This usually includes a "base" or "main" template file. You can
view an example of this on our boilerplate
.
Learn how to create a child theme from an Asset Marketplace or default HubSpot theme in the
Knowledge Base
.
To create a child theme from a custom theme:
In your HubSpot account, navigate to
Marketing > Files and Templates > Design Tools.
In the finder, click the
File
dropdown menu and select
New theme.
Click the
Theme Starting Point
dropdown menu and select
Blank Theme
.
Enter a
name
in the
Theme Label
field.
To change where the child theme will be saved, click
Change
in the
File location
section. Click a
folder
, then click
Select
.
In the
theme.json
file, enter a
comma
at the end of line 5, then add a new line below line 5.
On line 6, add an
extends
statement, using a value of the path of the parent theme.
Copy code snippet
"extends": "path/to/theme"
"extends"
:
"path/to/theme"
By default, the child theme will inherit
fields.json
from the parent theme, so you do not need to create a separate
fields.json
for the child theme if you don't plan on updating it.
Create a child theme with the CLI
You can create a child theme with the CLI. You must complete
the setup process for the CLI
before creating a child theme. Your child theme will inherit the templates and files from the parent theme. You will be able to edit the new theme within the CLI and in the Design Manager.
Create a new directory for your theme.
Copy code snippet
mkdir cms-project
xxxxxxxxxx
mkdir
cms-project
In the new directory, create a copy of the
theme.json
file of the parent theme.
Copy code snippet
cd cms-project
cp ~/src/cms-sprout-theme/src/theme.json
xxxxxxxxxx
2
1
cd
cms-project
2
cp
~/src/cms-sprout-theme/src/theme.json
In the copied
theme.json
file, add a comma to the end of line 5 and a new line below line 5 (or below the final line of the
responsive_breakpoints
, if they are present).
Add an
extends
statement to line 6 (or 14, or the appropriate line for your theme), using a value of the path of the parent theme.
Copy code snippet
"extends": "@hubspot/barricade"
xxxxxxxxxx
"extends"
:
"@hubspot/barricade"
By default, the child theme will inherit
fields.json
from the parent theme. Consequently, you don't need to create a separate
fields.json
for the child theme if you don't plan on updating it.
Upload your new theme and files to your HubSpot account.
Copy code snippet
hs upload cms-project cms-project
xxxxxxxxxx
hs upload cms-project cms-project

FAQs
Can I copy a child theme to another HubSpot account if the parent theme is from the Asset Marketplace?
Yes, as long as the “extends” path is the same in the other HubSpot account.
What assets are inherited from the parent theme?
All files are inherited from the parent theme unless they are overwritten in the child theme.
How can I override a particular asset from the parent theme?
A file in the same relative path of a child theme will overwrite the equivalent file from the parent theme. So, for instance, to overwrite
@marketplace/parent/theme/templates/about.html
you can create
/child/theme/templates/about.html
and make your edits to the new file. The new file will take effect instead of the inherited file. This applies to your
fields.json
file as well as other files in the theme.
How can I create new pages using the child theme?
When you create a new page, your child theme will appear as an option under
Your Themes
on the theme selection screen. Learn more about creating pages using themes in the
Knowledge Base.
How can I edit an existing page to use a child theme instead of the parent theme?
You can replace your page template with the equivalent template from the new theme. For instance,
replace the template
landing-page.html
(in the parent theme) with the template
landing-page.html
(in the new theme).
How can I edit a template’s label on the page creation screen?
You can change the label of your template by editing the HTML file. The label is located in a comment at the top of your theme file.
Can I create a child theme from a child theme?
Currently you cannot create a child theme from a child theme.

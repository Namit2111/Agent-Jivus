Hide modules and sections
When developing a theme, you can configure the
theme.json
to hide specific modules and sections from the editor. This enables you to curate the list of modules and sections available to content creators when building pages, blogs, and global content, rather than having all modules and sections appear for all content types. Using this feature, you can also hide
HubSpot default modules
in favor of your own versions.
You can hide modules and sections in the following ways:
Within themes:
you can hide default modules, but not custom modules. Similarly, you cannot hide custom sections in a theme. To exclude a custom module or section from a theme, you should instead delete the module or section from the theme.
Within templates:
you can hide default modules, custom modules, and sections.
When hiding modules and sections, keep the following in mind:
When hiding HubSpot default modules in a
template
, ensure that the module is wrapped in single quotes (
'
). For example,
'@hubSpot/follow_me'
. This complies with YAML, which template annotations are based on.
You must use the relative path when specifying a hidden module. Using an absolute path will result in the module not being hidden.
Hide default modules in a theme
To hide all default modules, set
"hide_all_default_modules": true
in the
theme.json
file
To hide specific default modules in a theme, you'll need to add a list of hidden modules to a
hidden_modules
array in the
theme.json
file.
For example, if you wanted to hide HubSpot's default button and form modules from a theme, your code would look like the following:
Copy code snippet
// example theme.json
{
"label": "CMS Theme Boilerplate",
"preview_path": "./templates/home.html",
"screenshot_path": "./images/template-previews/home.png",
"enable_domain_stylesheets": false,
"license": "./license.txt",
"responsive_breakpoints": [
{
"name": "mobile",
"mediaQuery": "@media (max-width: 767px)",
"previewWidth": { "value": 477 }
}
],
"hidden_modules": ["@hubspot/button", "@hubspot/form"]
}
1
// example theme.json
2
{
3
"label"
:
"CMS Theme Boilerplate"
,
4
"preview_path"
:
"./templates/home.html"
,
5
"screenshot_path"
:
"./images/template-previews/home.png"
,
6
"enable_domain_stylesheets"
:
false
,
7
"license"
:
"./license.txt"
,
8
"responsive_breakpoints"
: [
9
{
10
"name"
:
"mobile"
,
11
"mediaQuery"
:
"@media (max-width: 767px)"
,
12
"previewWidth"
: {
"value"
:
477
}
13
}
14
],
15
"hidden_modules"
: [
"@hubspot/button"
,
"@hubspot/form"
]
16
}
To hide all default modules, set
"hide_all_default_modules": true
in
theme.json
.
Hide modules and sections in a template
To hide modules and sections in a specific template, you'll need to add a list of
hiddenModules
and
hiddenSections
in the template annotations. For example:
Copy code snippet
// example template file
<!--
templateType: page
isAvailableForNewContent: true
label: Ticket listing
screenshotPath: ../images/template-previews/ticket-listing.png
hiddenModules:
- '@hubSpot/follow_me'
- ../modules/form
hiddenSections:
- ../sections/card
-->
xxxxxxxxxx
12
1
// example template file
2
<!--
3
templateType: page
4
isAvailableForNewContent: true
5
label: Ticket listing
6
screenshotPath: ../images/template-previews/ticket-listing.png
7
hiddenModules:
8
- '@hubSpot/follow_me'
9
- ../modules/form
10
hiddenSections:
11
- ../sections/card
12
-->

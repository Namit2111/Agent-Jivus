List and update templates in the HubSpot Template Marketplace
Once you’ve created a
Template Marketplace provider account
, you can use it to create template listings and submit them for approval to be listed on the
HubSpot Template Marketplace
.
Please note:
you can only have
one
new submission of each type (module or template) in review at a time. A submission is considered “new” if it’s not currently published or approved.
Before listing your template on the Template Marketplace, fill out your Provider profile:
In your Template Marketplace provider account, navigate to
Template Marketplace
>
Provider profile
.
In the
Company Info
section, fill out all the fields. These fields will appear on your template listings. You will not be able to edit your company name once it's been chosen and will need to contact HubSpot Support to change it.
In the
Contact Info
section, fill out all the fields for both the
Main contact
and
Developer contact
sections. This information will only be used if HubSpot needs to contact you about a listing and
will not
appear on any listing pages.
In the
Payment Info
section, add your supported payment methods. You can connect either PayPal or Stripe as a payment gateway. If your payment information causes the payment gateway to stop working, your templates will be temporarily delisted to avoid a negative customer impact.
Create a template listing
To create and submit a theme or module listing:
In your Template Marketplace provider account, navigate to
Template Marketplace
.
In the upper right, click
Create listing
.
Select either
Create theme listing
or
Create module listing
.
Review the information on the
Provider Information
page, then click
Next
.
Review your payment information on the
Payment Information
page, then click
Next
.
Select the
theme or module
you want to list, then click
Save and continue
. You'll then be brought to the listing editor
The listing editor is broken up into five tabs:
Listing Info
,
Theme/Module Details
,
Category
,
Support
, and
Review
. All information is required unless otherwise indicated. Review all listing page requirements
here
.
On the
Review
tab, validate your template’s code and preview your listing. If everything looks good, click
Submit for review.
Please note:
do not change the template folder name once submitted. The template listing is directly linked to this folder upon submission. You will not be able to resubmit or update the template after changing the folder name.
Update a template listing
After creating a template listing, you can update it in your Template Marketplace provider account. If you've made changes to a template, you'll need to revalidate it before those changes are pushed out. If you do not revalidate, only the content on the Marketplace listing page will be updated.
To update a template listing:
In your Template Marketplace provider account, navigate to
Template Marketplace
>
Listings
.
Click the
name
of the listing you want to update. You'll be redirected to the listing editor.
Make any needed changes to the listing information, template details, categories, and support options, then click the
Review
tab to review your changes.
On the
Review
tab, check whether your template's code has changed since its last validation:
If you've made no changes to the template, HubSpot will display a confirmation message in the
Theme source code
tile or
Module source code
tile showing that your validation is up to date.
If you've made changes to the template, HubSpot will display an alert in the source code tiles. To send these changes to the Marketplace, you'll first need to click
Run validation
.
